</div>

<p class='c007' >“’Tis meself that calls this pretty tough
mountain climbin’, and me athinkin’ all the
while the road to Uncle Job’s cattle ranch
would take us along the bully open plain all
the way!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold your horses, Jimmy; we’ve got to
about the end of this hill climbing. After we
cross this divide it’s going to be the kind of
travel you mention, all on the level. One more
town to pass through, and then we strike out
for the ranch. Any minute now we ought to
glimpse the low country through this canyon
that we’ve been following over the ridge.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“There it is right now, Ned, and let me tell
you I’m glad myself that this hard work is
nearly over with. Whew! did you ever see a
prettier picture than this is, with the whole
country spread out like a big map?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And that’s where we aim to spend some
little time, is it, boys?” asked a third one of
the four boys who, leading a loaded pack burro
apiece, had been climbing a range of rocky
mountains away down in a corner of Nevada
not a great distance from the Arizona border.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, that’s going to be our stamping ground,
Jack, for some little time to come. My uncle
Job Haines has his ranch away over there somewhere
or other, in the hazy distance. His
partner, another uncle of mine, James Henshaw,
is with him in the business—you know my
mother was married twice, and this last gentleman
is the brother of her first husband, which
is how I come to have so many uncles. What
d’ye say to resting up a bit here before we start
down the grade, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The way three of them turned toward the
other young fellow was evidence enough in
itself to show that he must be the leader of the
little company, which was in fact the truth.</p>

<p class='c008' >All of the mountain climbers were wearing
rather faded but serviceable khaki suits, which
with the leggins and campaign hats proved that
they must belong to some troop of Boy Scouts.
But it was many days’ journey from their
present surroundings to the scene of their home
activities, for they belonged in New York City.</p>

<p class='c008' >Those of our young readers who have had the
pleasure and privilege of possessing one or more
of the previous volumes connected with this
series of stories will readily recognize the four
lads as old and valued acquaintances. For the
sake of the few who may not have enjoyed
meeting the lively quartette before, a few
sentences of introduction may be necessary
before going on further. And while they are
resting both themselves and their pack animals,
at the same time drinking in the magnificent
scenery that was spread out before them,
looking toward the southeast, it would seem to
be a fitting opportunity for this service.</p>

<p class='c008' >The leader of the little party was Ned Nestor,
who also served as assistant scout master of
the troop, having duly qualified for the office
according to the rules of the organization.
He was a good hunter and tracker, and possessed
a wide knowledge of woodcraft in its best sense.</p>

<p class='c008' >Some time previous to this Ned had been
given various chances to work for the Secret
Service of the Government at Washington,
and had conducted himself in such a manner as
to win the confidence of the authorities. They
realized that there were many opportunities
when a bright lad might accomplish things
unsuspected where a man would be apt to slip
up. And judging from the success which had
on most occasions followed Ned’s taking up
a case, it appeared as though this might have
been a wise move.</p>

<p class='c008' >One of the other boys, a short chap with red
hair and a freckled face, often acted as Ned’s
assistant in these dangerous adventures. His
name was Jimmy McGraw, and at one time he
had been a regular tough little Bowery boy
in New York, until he happened to meet Ned
under strange conditions, and was virtually
adopted by the other’s father, so that he now
made his home with the Nestors. Jimmy could
not entirely shake off some of the old habits;
and this accounted for his making use of a little
slang now and then, when trying to express
himself forcibly.</p>

<p class='c008' >The third lad was named Jack Bosworth.
Jack was a splendid chum, faithful as the needle
can be to the pole, and as brave as he was
robust. His father being a rich corporation
lawyer and capitalist, the boy had been allowed
to do pretty much as he chose. Fortunately
Jack was a true scout in every sense of the word,
and could be depended upon to keep out of
mischief. He believed Ned Nestor to be the
finest patrol leader that ever wore the khaki
and was ready to follow his lead, no matter
where it took him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry Stevens, the fourth and last of the
quartette, was inclined to be a student rather
than a lover of the trail and hunters’ camp.
His hobby seemed to lie along the study of
wild animals’ habits, and also the history of
the ancient Indian tribes that, centuries back,
were known to have inhabited the southwestern
portion of our country. He had kept harping
all the while upon the subject of the strange
Zunis, the Hopis, and the Moquis, all of whom
he knew had descended from the original
cliff-dwellers. And he hoped before going back
home again to find a chance to investigate
some of their quaint rock dwellings high up in
the cliffs bordering the wonderful Colorado
Canyon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry was really on his way to the ranch of
his uncles. Not being in any hurry he and
his chums had first visited San Francisco,
and then Los Angeles. While here they somehow
conceived the rather singular idea of
crossing the desert afoot, in order to have new
experiences, and be able to say that they knew
what it was to find themselves alone on a sandy
tract that stretched as far as the eye could see
in every direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >What remarkable adventures had come their
way while carrying out this scheme have already
been set down in the pages of the volume just
preceding this book, under the title of “Boy
Scouts in Death Valley,” so there would be no
need of our repeating any of the exciting episodes
here. They had purchased the four burros
from a discouraged party of men who were
prospecting for gold in the mountains to the
west of the parched valley of the evil name.</p>

<p class='c008' >Since they managed to escape from Death
Valley, after almost leaving their bones there
as the penalty of their rashness, some days had
passed; in fact it was now a week later. They
had done considerable traveling in that time,
and overcome all obstacles with their accustomed
ability.</p>

<p class='c008' >All of them had grown weary of so much
mountain climbing, and Jimmy really voiced
the united sentiment of the party when he
declared that he was yearning for a chance to
see the open plain, with grass instead of the
eternal blistering sand, and mottes of trees
dotting the picture with pleasing bunches of
green that would be a relief to their tortured
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >So they sat there and talked of the past, as
well as tried to lift the veil that hid the immediate
future, as though anxious to know what
awaited them in the new life to which they were
hastening.</p>

<p class='c008' >Finally Ned Nestor arose and stretched himself,
as he remarked:</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think we’d better be on our way, fellows,
if we hope to get down there to the level before
night comes along. The sun’s headed for the
west, you notice, and as this ridge will shut
him out from us early, we haven’t any too much
time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I guess you’re about right there, Ned,”
commented Jack; “and for one I want to say
I’d be right glad to make camp at the foot of
the mountains. We can’t say good-bye to
these rocky backbones of the region any too
soon to please me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The four burros had rested after their arduous
climb, and there was not the least difficulty
about getting them started moving. In fact
they seemed to already scent the grass of the
plains below, so different from anything that
had been encountered thus far on the trip,
and were showing signs of a mad desire to reach
the lowlands.</p>

<p class='c008' >Several times Ned had to caution one of the
others about undue haste.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold your burro in more, Jimmy,” he would
say; “there are too many precipices on our
trail to take chances of his slipping, and dragging
you over with him. To be sure mules and
donkeys are clever about keeping their footing
and almost equal Rocky Mountain sheep, or the
chamois of the Alps that way; but they can
stumble, we know, and it might come at a bad
time. They’re wild to get down out of this;
but for one I don’t care to take a short cut by
plunging over a three hundred foot precipice.
Easy now, Teddy; behave yourself, old boy.
That’s an ugly hole we’re passing right now,
and we want to go slow.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy himself was apt to be a reckless sort
of a chap; and many a time did Ned have to
check his impatience in days gone by. Jack,
too, often did things without sufficient consideration,
though he could hold himself in on occasion;
while Harry seldom if ever had to be cautioned,
for he was inclined to be slow.</p>

<p class='c008' >They often found themselves put to it to
make progress, for while they followed what
seemed to be a trail over the ridge, it had been
seldom used, and many obstructions often
blocked the way.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once they had to get wooden crowbars and
pry a huge boulder loose that had fallen so as
to completely block progress. Fortunately it
had been easy to move it a few inches at a
time, until they sent it into a gulf that yawned
alongside the trail, to hear it crash downward
for hundreds of feet, and make the face of the
mountain quiver under the shock.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this fashion they had managed to get a
third of the way down from the apex of the
ridge, and Ned, comparing the time with the
progress made, announced it as his opinion that
he believed they would be easily able to make the
bottom before night came on.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That sounds all to the good to me, Ned,”
declared Jimmy, with a broad grin on his freckled
face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hope you’re a true prophet, that’s all,”
said Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I agree with Ned,” Jack broke in with, “and
say, we ought to make the foot of the range
before night, the way we’re going, unless
we hit up against some bad spot that’ll hold us
up worse than we’ve struck yet.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That isn’t likely to happen,” Ned observed,
“because the further down we get the easier
the going ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I notice that the holes are just as deep,”
Harry told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And a fall would jolt a feller as hard too,
seems like,” Jimmy admitted as he craned his
neck to look over at a place where the trail
was only a few feet wide with a blank wall on
the right and an empty void on the left.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry nervously caught his breath, and called
out:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Better be careful there, Jimmy, how you bend
over and look down. You might get dizzy
and take a lurch or the frisky burro give a lug
just then and upset you. We all think too
much of you to want to gather up your remains
down at the bottom of a precipice.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy laughed and seemed pleased at the
compliment. He did not again bother about
looking over, but occupied himself with managing
his pack animal, which kept showing an
increasing desire to hasten. At one point
Ned had stopped to tighten the ropes that held
the pack on his burro, and in some manner
Jimmy managed to get at the head of the little
procession that wound, single file, down that
steep mountain trail.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was Ned’s intention to assume the lead
again at the first opportunity, when he could
pass the others. Meantime he thought he
could keep an observant eye on Jimmy, so as to
restrain him in case he began to show any sign
of rashness.</p>

<p class='c008' >After all it was not so much Jimmy’s fault
that it happened, but the fact that his burro
had quite lost its head in the growing desire
to get down to the green pastures from which
it had been debarred so very long, and for which
it was undoubtedly hungering greatly.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the unlucky animal should chance
to make that stumble just at the time of passing
another narrow place in the trail, where the
conditions again caused them to move in single
file, was one of those strange happenings which
sometimes spring unannounced upon the unwary
traveler.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy at one time even walked along with
the end of the rope wound about his waist in
a lazy fashion; but Ned had immediately told
him never to think of doing such a thing again,
when there was even the slightest chance of
the burro slipping over the edge of the sloping
platform and dragging his master along. But
right then Jimmy had such a rigid clutch upon
the rope that he did not seem to know enough
to let go when the pack animal stumbled, tried
to cling desperately to the rocky edge, and then
vanished from sight into the gulf.</p>

<p class='c008' >In fact Jimmy’s first idea seemed to be a
desire to drag the tottering animal back to safety,
and it was because he was tugging for all he
was worth on the rope that he was pulled over
the edge himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >The other three scouts seemed to be petrified
with horror when they saw their plucky but
rash chum dragged over. None of them could
jump to his assistance on account of the burros
being in the way and plunging and kicking
wildly, as though terrified at the fate that
had overtaken their mate.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was at the end of the line, and Harry,
though not far from the spot where the terrible
accident happened, seemed to be too terrified
to know what to do, until it was all over, and
poor Jimmy had vanished from their view.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />LUCKY JIMMY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Oh! Ned, he’s gone—poor Jimmy—pulled
right over by that burro!” Harry was crying
as he stood there almost petrified with horror,
while his own pack animal acted as though it
might be terrified by the fate that had overtaken
its mate, for it snorted and pulled back
strenuously.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned knew that unless the remaining three
burros were quieted a still greater disaster was
apt to overtake them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Speak to your animal, Harry; get him
soothed right away! Easy now, Teddy, stand
still where you are! It’s all right, old fellow!
Back up against the rock and stand still there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned as he spoke in this strain managed to
throw a coil or two of the leading rope over a
jutting spur of rock. Then turning round,
he crept on hands and knees to the edge of the
yawning precipice and looked over, shuddering
to note that while not nearly so high as that
other precipice had been, at the same time the
fall must be all of seventy feet.</p>

<p class='c008' >There at the foot he could see the unfortunate
burro on his back and with never a sign of life
about him. Doubtless that tumble must have
effectually broken his neck and ended his days
of usefulness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you see him, Ned?” asked a trembling
voice close by, and the scout leader knew that
Jack too had crawled to the edge in order to
discover what had become of poor Jimmy
McGraw.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not yet,” replied Ned, sadly; “he may be
hidden under the burro, or lying in among that
clump of bushes.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But glory be, he ain’t, all the same!” said a
voice just then that thrilled them all. “If
ye be lookin’ over this way ye’ll discover the
same Jimmy aholdin’ on with a death grip
to a fine old rock that sticks out from the face
of the precipice. But ’tis me arms that feel
like they was pulled part way out of the sockets
with the jerk; and I’d thank ye to pass a rope
down as soon as ye get over the surprise of havin’
a ghost address ye.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bully for you, Jimmy!” exclaimed Jack;
“seems like you’ve got nearly as many lives as
a cat. Hold on like anything, because Ned’s
getting a rope right now, and he’ll heave it over
in three shakes of a lamb’s tail. Don’t look
down, Jimmy, but keep your eye on me. We’ll
pull you out of that in a jiffy, sure we will. And
here comes Ned right now with the rope. He’s
even made a noose at the end, so as to let you
put your foot in the same. Keep holding on,
Jimmy, old fellow!”</p>

<p class='c008' >In this manner, then, did Jack try to encourage
the one in peril, so as to stiffen his muscles,
and cause him to keep his grip on that friendly
crag that had saved him from sharing the
dreadful fate of the wretched burro.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy had fortunately kept his wits about
him, and although the strain was very great,
because he could find no rest for his dangling
feet, he managed to hold his awkward position
until the rope came within reach.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Be careful, now, how you manage!” called
Ned, from his position fifteen feet above the
head of the imperiled scout. “Let me angle
for your foot, and once I get the noose fast
around it, you can rest your weight safely.
But Jimmy, remember not to let go with one
hand, because your other might slip. Leave it
all to me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was already working the rope so that the
open noose twirled slowly around, coming in
contact with Jimmy’s foot, which the other
thrust out purposely. While no expert in such
angling and more or less worked up with fears
lest Jimmy suddenly lose his precarious hold,
and go down to his death, Ned presently met
with success. The noose passed over the waiting
foot, and was instantly jerked tight by a quick
movement from above.</p>

<p class='c008' >By then Jack was alongside the scout master
eager to lend his assistance when it came to
the point of lifting Jimmy. Harry, too, hovered
just behind them, unable to look over because
it made him dizzy when so terribly excited,
but only too ready to take hold of the end of
the rope and bracing his feet against some
projection of the rocky trail, throw all his
weight into the endeavor to draw the one they
meant to rescue to the safety of the path.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was speedily but cautiously accomplished,
for Ned would not allow himself to be needlessly
hurried, knowing how disasters so often
result from not taking the proper care.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was looking a trifle peaked and worried
as he came clambering over the edge of the
narrow path, assisted by Ned, who as soon as
he could get a grip on the other scout’s jacket
knew that all was well. No sooner did Jimmy
realize that he was surely safe than he proceeded
to indulge on one of his favorite grins,
although they could see that a deep sigh of
gratitude accompanied the same.</p>

<p class='c008' >The very first thing he did was to turn
around, and lying flat on his chest, look back
down into that gulf from which he had just
been dragged.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, whiz! but that was somethin’ of a drop,
believe me!” he remarked, trying to keep his
voice from trembling. “And there lies me silly
old burro on his back with never a sign of a kick
acomin’. He’s sure on the blink and whatever
am I agoin’ to do now, without any Navajo
blanket to sleep in nights? Mebbe we might
have ropes aplenty to lower me down there,
so I could recover me valuables. ’Tis a piece of
great luck I had me Marlin gun in me hands
at the time and dropped it on the ledge, so I did.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If we couldn’t get the things any other way,
Jimmy,” announced Ned, “perhaps I’d agree
to that spliced rope business, because we’ve
got more than thirty yards of good line with us,
but I’d go down myself and not let you try a
second time. Still I don’t think it’ll be necessary.
From what I see of the lay of the mountain
we can reach that place after we leave this
narrow trail.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy did not insist. Perhaps his nerves
had been more roughly shaken by his recent
experience than he cared to admit; and the
possibility of again finding himself dangling
in space did not appeal very strongly to him.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was just as well that Ned decided the
matter as he did, for they found that once the
end of the narrow stretch of rock was gained
it was no great task to creep along the side of
the mountain to the place where the dead pack
animal lay.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned and Jack made the little journey and in
due time turned up again carrying with them
all that had been upon the burro, save the water
keg.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We left that behind,” explained Ned,
“because as we are done with desert travel
for this trip we won’t find any need of such a
thing. But here’s your precious Navajo colored
blanket, Jimmy; likewise we’ve saved what
grub there was in the pack.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good for you, Ned; I’d hated to lose that
blanket the worst kind, you know; and as for
the food end of the deal, well, what’s the use
telling you how I feel about that when you all
know that I’m the candy boy when the dinner
horn blows.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was a great “feeder,” as Jack called
it, and on many an occasion this weakness on
his part had made him the butt of practical
jokes on the part of his chums. But Jimmy
was not the one to give up any cherished object
simply because some one laughed at him on
account of it. He was more apt to join in the
merriment and consider it all a good joke.</p>

<p class='c008' >The journey was now resumed, and the balance
of the afternoon they met with no new
hardships or perils worth recording. When
the day was done and the shadows of coming
night began to steal forth from all their hiding places
where the bright sunlight had failed to
locate them, the four scouts had reached the
foot of the rocky mountain range and looked
out upon the plain.</p>

<p class='c008' >Here they made camp and passed a pleasant
night with nothing to disturb their slumbers
save the distant howl of a wolf, which was a
familiar sound in the ears of these lads, since
they had roughed it on many occasions in the
past in more than a few strange parts of the
world.</p>

<p class='c008' >Although they had recently passed through
some very arduous experiences these were only
looked on as vague reminiscences by these
energetic chums. The future beckoned with
rosy fingers and that level plain looked very
attractive in their eyes, after such a long and
painful trip across the burning deserts and
through that terrible Death Valley, where so
many venturesome prospectors, gold-mad, have
left their bones as a monument to their folly.</p>

<p class='c008' >When morning came again they cooked
breakfast with new vim. And the fragrant
odor of the coffee seemed to appeal to them
with more than ordinary force because of the
bright prospect that opened before them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ned says it might be only two more days
before we get close to Uncle Job’s ranch,”
remarked Harry, as he assisted Jimmy in
getting breakfast; for since the latter was so
fond of eating his comrades always saw to it
that he had a hand in the preparation of the
meals, to which Jimmy was never heard to
offer the slightest objection.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then it’s me that will have to be studying
harder on all them cowboy terms so they won’t
take me for a greeny,” Jimmy went on to say
in reply. “You just wait and see how I branch
out a full-blown puncher. Right now I c’n
ride a bucking pony and stick in the saddle like
a leech; and I’m practicin’ how to throw a
rope, though I must say I don’t get it very good
and sometimes drop the old loop over my own
coco instead of the post I’m aimin’ to lasso.
But I’ll never give it up till I get there. That’s
the way with the McGraws, we’re all set in our
way and want baseball championships and
everything else that’s good to own.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jimmy,” called out Jack just then, “I
think if you didn’t talk so much we’d be getting
our breakfast sooner, because you kind of cool
things off. There, see how the coffee boils
like mad whenever you hold up. How about
it, Harry, isn’t it nearly done? I’m feeling
half-starved, to tell you the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then I’m not the only pebble on the beach
this time, it seems,” chuckled Jimmy, who was
so used to being made fun of on account of his
voracious appetite that he felt happy to find
that someone else could also get hungry on
occasion.</p>

<p class='c008' >“In three minutes we’ll give you the high sign,
Jack,” Harry announced and he was as good
as his word, for it was not long before the chums
might have been seen discussing the food that
had been prepared and making merry over the
meal as was their usual custom.</p>

<p class='c008' >Starting forth in high spirits they began to
head across the plain and at about noon all of
them were electrified on hearing the distant
but unmistakable whistle of a locomotive,
showing that they were approaching the railroad.</p>

<p class='c008' >After their recent experiences in the dead
lands this sign of civilization was enough to
thrill them through and through. Jimmy was
immediately waving his hat and letting off a
few yells to denote his overwhelming joy;
while even Ned looked around with more or less
of a smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sounds like home, don’t it?” asked Jack,
beaming on the rest. “Takes you back to
good old New York, where you can sit down
next to a plate of ice cream when your tongue
feels thick from the heat and cool off. Seems
like I’d never get my fill of cold stuff again.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Pushing on they presently sighted the railroad
and also discovered that just as Ned had
figured would be the case, they were approaching
a town.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s where we ordered our mail to be
sent on from Los Angeles, up to the tenth, and
I hope we find letters waiting for us,” Harry
remarked; for he was quite a correspondent,
though not in the same class with Frank Shaw,
another member of the Black Bear Patrol,
whose father owned a big daily in New York
and who often contributed letters to its columns
when he was away on trips with Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned on his part was wondering whether he
would receive anything in the way of business
communications from the Government people
in Washington, for it would be forwarded on
from Los Angeles if such a message did come in
cipher.</p>

<p class='c008' >So anxious were the boys to reach the settlement
on the railroad that it was decided not to
stop for any lunch at noon but to push right
along. If there was any eating place in the
town they could get a bite before leaving; and
the change from camp fare might be agreeable
to them all.</p>

<p class='c008' >At two o’clock they reached the place, which
was hardly of respectable size, although it had
a station and post office. The first thing the
boys did was to head for this latter place and
ask for mail, which was handed out after the
old man had slowly gone over several packages.
Strangers were such a novelty in that Nevada
railroad settlement that the postmaster evidently
was consumed with curiosity to know what
could have brought four lively looking boys
dressed in khaki suits very much on the same
pattern as United States regulars, to that
jumping-off place. But they did not bother
themselves explaining and he had to take it out
in guessing that the Government was so hard
pushed for recruits now in the army that they
had to enlist boys not fully grown.</p>

<p class='c008' >While the other boys were eagerly devouring
the contents of the various envelopes they had
received, bearing the New York post mark,
Ned, who had put his own letters in his pocket
for later reading, sauntered over to the station to
interview the telegraph agent, who was also the
ticket man, express agent and filled various
other offices as well after the usual custom of
these small towns.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was only a short time later that Jack,
Harry and Jimmy, still devouring the long letters
they had received, in which all the news of the
home circles was retailed, saw Ned walking
briskly toward them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s struck something or other that’s given
him reason to chirk up,” announced the observant
Jimmy, as he took a shrewd look at Ned’s
face on the scout master drawing near. “Ten
to one he’s had word from the head of the Secret
Service in Washington. It’d sure be pretty
punk now if after comin’ so far over deserts
and the like to visit your uncle, we had to drop
off here and take the train back to Los Angeles,
so Ned could help gather in some gang of counterfeiters
or look up a bunch of smugglers bringing
the Heathen Chinese across the Mexican border
while all that fighting is goin’ on down there
between Villa and Huerta.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned quickly joined them. They could see
from the alert look on his face that something
must have happened since he left them shortly
before to arouse Ned. His eyes shone with
resolution and he had the look that appears
on a hunter’s face when he discovers the track
of the animal he had long wanted to bag.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you find a message waiting for you
here, Ned?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what I did,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then it must have been from Washington?”
suggested Jack, anxiously. “But let’s hope
for Harry’s sake it won’t call you off from this
scheme we’ve got started.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the strangest thing of it all,” replied
Ned; “because, you see, this message was
meant to send me from Los Angeles straight
down into this very section of the Colorado
River country.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />THE HELPING HAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >When Ned made this announcement the others
exchanged looks in which wonder struggled
with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell me about that, now,” muttered Jimmy;
“was there ever anything like the luck that
chases after us all the while? Here we start
out to visit Harry’s uncle, so he might carry
out a mission that his folks sent him on, and of
course the Government must a guessed all about
it, since they went and laid a game to be hatched
out right in the same part of the Wild and
Wooly West. Can you beat it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let Ned tell us what the game is, can’t you,
Jimmy?” demanded Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, and please don’t break in again with
your remarks until he’s all through,” added
Jack. “It bothers a fellow to make connections
when you get started. If you must talk, why,
we’ll throw in and hire a hall for the occasion.
Now, Ned, tell us what the Secret Service folks
want you to do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve had a message in cipher from my people
in Washington, telling me that while I’m out
in this section they’d like me to look up one
Clem Parsons, who’s been wanted for a long time
on the charge of counterfeiting Government
notes. When last heard from he was running
a stage line somewhere in the country of the
Colorado and doing a little in the way of
fleecing unsuspecting travelers who come out
here to see the wonders of the Canyon. So
from now on we’ll begin to ask questions and
see whether we can get on the trail of this
gentleman who’s given some of the smartest
agents in the Secret Service the call-down.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And then they have to depend on Ned Nestor
and his able assistant, Jimmy McGraw,” remarked
the last mentioned scout; “excuse me, fellers,
but if you don’t blow your own horn, who
d’ye reckon’ll be fool enough to do it for you?
But Ned, if our luck holds as good as it generally
does, chances are ten to one this same Clem
Parsons will come tumbling right up against us.
It seems like you might be a magnet and they
all have to come our way sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Any description of what he looks like?”
asked Jack, who had known Ned to get similar
orders on previous occasions and could guess
that it was not all left to his imagination.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, they tell me he is tall and thin and has
a scar on his left cheek. He used to be a cow
puncher at one time and might be working at
his old trade now. That’s a point to remember
when we get to the Double Cross Ranch.
Every puncher will have to run the gantlet
of our eyes and if one of them happens to be
marked with a scar on his left cheek, it’ll be a
bad day for him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now, wouldn’t it be queer if we <i>did</i> run
across the mutt there at your uncle’s place,
Harry?” remarked Jimmy. “But here we are
again, Ned, uniting business with pleasure
like we’ve done heaps of times before now.
Mr. Clem Parsons, I’m sure sorry for you when
this combination gets started to work, because
you’ve <i>got</i> to come in out of the wet and that’s
all there is to it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >It might appear that Jimmy was much given
to boasting; but as a rule he made good, so that
this failing might be forgiven by those who
knew him and his propensity for joking.</p>

<p class='c008' >They moved out of town after getting a
pretty poor apology for a lunch at the tavern.
Jimmy declared that he would starve on such
fare and announced his intention of immediately
opening a box of crackers he had purchased at
a local store so as to keep himself from suffering.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned, as was his habit, had interviewed about
everybody that crossed his path, so as to improve
upon the rude map he carried and which
he had found to be faulty on several occasions,
which fact caused him to distrust it as a guide.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We ought to make the ranch by tomorrow
evening, if all goes well,” he told his three chums,
as they walked onward over the plain, still
heading almost due southwest.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not much danger of anything upsetting our
calculations from now on,” observed Jack,
“unless we meet up with drunken punchers,
run across some bad men who have been chased
by the sheriff’s posse out of the railroad towns
and who try to make a living by holding up
travelers once in six months; or else get caught
in a fine old prairie fire.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, that last could happen, that’s right,”
Jack went on to exclaim, looking a little uneasily
at the dead grass that in places completely
concealed the greener growth underneath. “If
a big gale was blowing and a spark should get
into this stuff she would go awhooping along
as fast as a train could run. That’s something
I’ve often read about and thought I’d like to see,
but come to think of it, now that I’m on the
ground, I don’t believe I care much about it
after all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“They say it’s a grand sight,” Harry volunteered;
“but according to my mind a whole lot
depends on which side of the fire you happen
to be. What’s interesting to some might even
mean death to others.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I’ve read lots about the same,” admitted
Jack, “and of the trouble people have
had in saving themselves when chased by one of
these fires on the plains. If we do see one of
the same here’s hoping we are to windward
of the big blaze.”</p>

<p class='c008' >When the sun sank that evening they were
hurrying to reach what seemed to be a stream
of some sort, judging from the line of trees
that cut across the plain and which only grow
where there is more or less water to be had.</p>

<p class='c008' >The three burros must have scented the
presence of water, for there was no keeping
the animals within bounds. They increased
their pace until they were almost on the run;
and Jimmy threw away the fag end of a whip
with which he had been amusing himself by
tickling the haunches of the burro in his charge
and urging him to move along faster.</p>

<p class='c008' >One of the animals started to bray in a fashion
that could have been easily heard half a mile
or more away.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hardly had the discordant sounds died away
than the boys were considerably surprised to
hear a shrill voice coming from directly ahead,
as though the exultant bray of the pack animal
had given warning of their presence to some one
who needed assistance the worst kind.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Help! Come quick and get me! Help—help!”
came the words as clear as a bell and
causing Harry and Jimmy to stare at each other
as though their first thought might have been
along the line of some deception that was being
practiced upon them.</p>

<p class='c008' >But there was Ned already on the jump
and shouting over his shoulder as he ran:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jimmy, give your burro over to Harry
to look after; you too, Jack and follow me on
the run!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That suits me all right!” cried Jack; “here
Harry, please look after my pack!” and with
these words he was off at full speed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was close at his heels. He had only
waited long enough to snatch his rifle from the
top of the pack on the burro that had been
given into his charge after his own had been
lost in the mountain disaster. Jimmy was
always thinking they might be attacked by
Indians off their reservation or else run across
some bad men who liked to play their guns
on strangers just to see them dance. For that
reason he seldom if ever allowed himself to be
caught far away from his repeating Marlin
these days.</p>

<p class='c008' >When they had pushed into the patch of
cottonwoods they found that Ned was already
at work trying to lend the assistance that had
been so lustily called for in that childish treble.</p>

<p class='c008' >A figure was in the stream, although just his
head and a small portion of his body could be
seen. He was stretching out his hands towards
Ned in a beseeching manner that at first puzzled
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, I declare if it ain’t a little boy!” he
exclaimed; “but what’s he doin’ out there,
I want to know? Why don’t he come ashore
if the water’s too deep. What ails the cub,
d’ye think, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t know—might be quicksand!” snapped
the other, as he once more started to hurry
forward.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was talking with the stranger now,
evidently assuring him that there was no
further need of anxiety since they had reached
the spot.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can’t you budge at all?” they heard him ask.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not a foot,” came the reply; “seems like
I mout be jest glued down here for keeps and
that’s a fact, stranger.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How long have you been caught there?”
asked the scout master.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Reckon as it mout be half hour er thereabouts,”
the boy who was held fast in the iron
grip of the treacherous quicksand told him; and
so far as Jack could see he did not exhibit any
startling signs of fright, for he was a boy of the
plains and evidently used to running into trouble
as well as perilous traps.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But,” Jack broke in with, “you never
shouted all that time, or we’d have heard you
long before we did?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Never let out a yip till I ketched that burro
speakin’,” the boy replied; “what was the use
when I didn’t think there was a single person
inside o’ five mile? I jest tried and tried to
git out but she hung on all the tighter; and the
water kept acreepin’ up till it’d been over my
mouth in ten minutes more I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, we are going to get you out of that in a
hurry, now,” Ned told him in a reassuring tone;
“Jack, climb up after me, to help pull. Jimmy,
you stand by to do anything else that’s wanted.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned, being a born woodsman, had immediately
noted the fact that the limb of a tree exactly
overhung the spot where the boy had been
trapped in the shifting sand. This made his
task the easier; but had it been otherwise he
would have found some means for accomplishing
his ends, even though he had to make a
mattress of bushes and branches on which to
safely approach the one in deadly peril.</p>

<p class='c008' >Creeping out on that stout limb Ned dropped
the noose of his rope down to the boy, who was
only some six feet below him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Put it around under your arms,” Ned told
him; but as though he understood the method
of procedure already, the boy in the sand was
even in the act of doing this when Ned spoke.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tie the end around the limb and let me pull
myself up, Mister, won’t you?” the boy pleaded,
as though ashamed of having been caught in a
trap, and wishing to do something looking to
his own release.</p>

<p class='c008' >This suited Ned just as well, though he meant
to have a hand in the pulling process himself
and also give Jack a chance. So when he
fastened the rope to the limb of the tree he did
so at a point midway between himself and Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get hold and pull!” he said in a low tone
to his chum; for already was the boy below straining
himself with might and main to effect his
own release.</p>

<p class='c008' >It would have proved a much harder task
than he contemplated; but the scouts did not
mean that he should exhaust himself any further
in trying. They managed to get some sort of
grip on the rope and then Ned called out
cheerily:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yo heave-o! here he comes! Yo-heave-o!
up with him, Jack! Now, once more, all
together for a grand pull—yo-heave-o! Hurrah,
he’s nearly out of the sand!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Five seconds later and the energetic boy was
scrambling across the limb of the tree; and in
as many minutes all of them had descended
to the ground, the end accomplished and nobody
much the worse for the experience.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It was a close call for me, that’s sure,”
the boy was saying, as he gravely went around
and shook hands with each one of the scouts,
not excepting Harry, who had meanwhile come
up, leading the three burros; “an’ I want you
all to know I’m glad that donkey let out his
whoop when he did. Why, I might a been all
under when you got here; but say, I lost my gun
and that makes me mad.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Looking at the boy more closely they were
struck with the fact that while he did not seem
to be more than nine years old, he was dressed
like a cow-puncher and had a resolute air.
How much of this was assumed in order to impress
them with the idea that he had not been
alarmed in the least by his recent peril, of course
no one could say. Ned was wondering how the
boy, brought up undoubtedly amidst such
perils and on the lookout for danger all the
while, could have fallen into such a silly little
trap as this.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What were you doing in the stream that
you stood there and let the sand suck you in?”
he asked as he proceeded to help the boy scrape
himself off so as to appear more presentable.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I was a little fool, all right,” the kid immediately
answered, with an expression of
absolute disgust on his sharp face; “you see, I
glimpsed a bunch of deer feeding just over
yonder to windward and as they were headin’
in this way I thought I’d lie low under the river
bank and wait till they got inside easy gunshot.
I tied my pony over in the thickest place of
the timber and then walked out to where the
water jest come to my knees, where I got low
down to wait. Say, I was that taken up with
watchin’ them deer afeedin’ up that I forgets
all about everything else and was some s’prised
to feel the water tricklin’ around my waist like.
After that I knowed the huntin’ game was all
up, and that less I wanted to be smothered I’d
have to get out in a hurry. But it didn’t
matter much how I pulled, an’ heaved and tried
to swim I jest stuck like I was bolted down to a
snubbin’ post and somebody had cinched the
girth on me. Then, after a while, when I was
expectin’ to swaller water, I heard that burro
singin’ and afore I could help it I jest hollored
out. Guess you must a thought it was a
maverick. I could a kicked myself right away
afterwards ’cause I give tongue so wild like!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned smiled. He realized that the cub had
imbibed the spirit of the Indian warrior who
disdains to display any weakness of the flesh.
No matter how much he may have been frightened
by his recent terrible predicament, he did
not choose any one to know about it. Indians
may <i>feel</i> fear but they have learned never to
show it by look or action and to go to their
deaths, if need be, taunting the foe.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” he told the small boy, “we intended
to camp for the night here close to the river
and we’d be glad to have you stay over with us.
Plenty of grub for everybody and it might be
much more pleasant than being by yourself.
We are not Western boys but then we’ve been
around more or less and know something about
how things are done out here. Will you join
us—er—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“My name is Amos, Amos Adams, and I’ll
be right well pleased to stay over with you to-night,
sure I will,” the boy went on to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >So it was settled, and out of just such small
things as their meeting Amos in such a strange
way great events sometimes spring. But none
of the scouts so much as suspected this when
they busied themselves preparing the camp,
building the cooking fire, and seeing that all the
animals were staked out to feed, after watering
them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />PICKING UP POINTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Ned, whatever do you imagine this kid is
doing out here all by himself?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack asked this question in a low tone. They
had cooked supper, and disposed of it promptly;
and there had been an abundance for the guest,
as well as the four chums. And now the two
scouts were lounging near the fire, while Jimmy
and Amos cleaned up the tin dishes and cooking
utensils; Harry meanwhile being busily engaged
with some notes he wanted to jot down for future
use, in comparing his recent experiences with
those of others who had suffered tortures in the
notorious Death Valley.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, you’ve heard as much of his talk as any
of us, Jack,” replied the leader of the expedition,
quietly, “and so far there’s been nothing said
about himself. I’m going to beckon to Amos to
come over here, and put a few leading questions
to him. Out here when a fellow is entertained
at the camp fire, it’s only fair that he give some
sort of an account of himself. Besides, Amos
looks so much like a kid, just as you say, that
it makes the thing seem queer.”</p>

<p class='c008' >A minute later, catching the eye of the boy, he
crooked his finger and nodded his head. Plainly
Amos understood, for he immediately came
across.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sit down, Amos,” Ned told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >The small boy in the cowboy suit did so, at
the same time allowing a sort of smile to come
upon his bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Want to know somethin’ about me, I
reckon?” he remarked, keenly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack chuckled as though amused at his shrewdness;
but Ned only said:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, ordinarily out here on the plains I
understand that men seldom express any curiosity
about their chance guests; it isn’t always
a safe thing to do. But you see, Amos, in your
case it’s different.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure it is; I get on to that, Mr. Scout Master,”
replied the boy, readily; for he had ere
this noticed the emblem which Ned bore upon his
khaki coat, and which stamped him as authorized
to answer to this name, which would
indicate that Amos knew something about the
Boy Scout business.</p>

<p class='c008' >“In the first place we chanced to be of some
little assistance to you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“A heap!” broke in the other, quickly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And then, excuse me for saying it, but you
are such a kid that anybody would be surprised
to run across you out by yourself, carrying a
gun, riding a pony like the smartest puncher
going, and after big game at the time you got
stuck in that quicksand—all of which, Amos,
must be our excuse for feeling that we’d like to
hear something about you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s only fair and square, Ned,” the boy
spoke up immediately; “Jimmy there has been
telling me the greatest lot of stuff about what
you fellows have been doing all over, that I’d
think he was stuffing me, only he held up his
hand right in the start, and declared he never
told anything but the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help him. And
I’m ready to tell you who I am, and what I’m
adoin’ out here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not that we think you’re anything that you
shouldn’t be, Amos,” put in Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, my name’s Amos Adams, just like I
said, and all my life I’ve been around a cattle
ranch. That’s why I know so much about
roping steers, and riding buckin’ broncs. I
guess I was in a saddle before my ma weaned me.
There are a few things mebbe I can’t quite do
as well as some of these here prize punchers, but
it’s only because I ain’t as strong as them, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Looking at his confident face the scouts believed
that Amos was only speaking the plain
truth.</p>

<p class='c008' >“My dad’s name is Hy Adams,” continued
the kid puncher. “I guess you ain’t been around
these diggin’s much yet, or you’d a heard who
he is. They call him the Bad Man of the Bittersweets,
and when he raises his fog-horn of a voice
lots of men that think themselves brave just
give a hitch to their shoulders this way,” and
he imitated it to the life as he spoke, “and does
what he tells ’em. That’s when he’s been drinkin’.
But then there are other times—oh, well,
I reckon, I hadn’t ought to tell family secrets.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We live in a cabin, ’bout ten miles away from
here. My dad, he’s in the cattle business, when
he don’t loaf. Sometimes he’s ’round home, and
agin he ain’t, just ’cordin’ to how things are
agoin’. Mam, she’s a little woman, but she
knows how to run the house. I gotter sister,
too, younger’n me, and her name it’s Polly. I
ain’t gone to school any to speak of, but mam,
she kinder teaches me, when I ain’t ridin’ out on
the range, or totin’ my gun on a hunt. That
makes me mad to think I lost my gun in the
drink there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No use hunting for it in the morning, I should
think?” suggested Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nary bit,” the boy replied quickly; “it’s
down under that shiftin’ sand long before now.
But then she was an old gun, and I’m savin’ up
to git a new six-shot rifle, so it don’t need to be
long now before I’ll be heeled agin.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is your father a rancher, then, Amos?” Jack
went on to ask, idly.</p>

<p class='c008' >The boy grinned and looked at him queerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” he replied, with a quaint drawl that
amused the scouts, “I don’t know as you could
call him that way, exactly. He’s been cow
puncher, and nigh everything else a man c’n be
down thisaway to make a livin’. Me and my
awful dad we don’t git on well. That’s one reason
I gen’rally skips out when he takes a notion
to lay ’round home for a spell. He knows right
well I ain’t afeard of him, if he has got the name
of bein’ a holy terror. I happen to belong to
the same fambly. ’Sides, he ain’t what you’d
call my real and true dad.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! I see, you adopted him, did you, Amos?”
Jack asked, laughingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“My mam she married agin after pop he was
planted, and they went an’ changed my name
from Scroggins to Adams. I don’t know which
I likes best; but Scroggins that’s honest, anyway,
which Adams ain’t—leastways some people
around this region say it ain’t. When I grows
up I reckon I’ll be a Scroggins, or else get a new
name.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Again the scouts exchanged amused glances.
Amos was certainly a most entertaining little
chap, with his quaint sayings.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now, you see, dad never comes home alone
any more, but fetches some of his cronies along
with him, and there’s unpleasant scenes ahappenin’
all the time; which is one of the
reasons why I skip out. They gets to drinkin’, too,
purty hard, till mam she has to douse a bucket
of water over each puncher, and start ’em off.
Mam she don’t approve of the kinds of business
that dad takes up. But he keeps amakin’ these
here visits to home further apart all the while,
’cause things ain’t as pleasant as they might be.
Some time mebbe he won’t come no more. I’m
bankin’ on that, which is one reason I ain’t never
laid a hand on him when he gets roarin’ like a
mad bull. There are others, too, but I wont
mention the same.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos had apparently been very frank with
his new friends. He seemed to have taken a
great fancy for them all, and, in turn, asked
many questions concerning their expected visit
to Harry’s uncle on Double Cross Ranch, which
place he knew very well.</p>

<p class='c008' >The conversation by degrees became general,
and finally the scouts went on to talk about their
own affairs. During this exchange of opinions,
it happened that the name of Clem Parsons was
mentioned by Ned. Perhaps it would be hardly
fair to call it “chance,” when in reality the scout
master wanted to find out whether the kid
puncher seemed to be familiar with the name of
the man whom the Government authorities in
Washington wished him to round up.</p>

<p class='c008' >The bait took, for immediately he heard Amos
say:</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s that, Clem Parsons? Say, I happen
to know a man by that name, and he’s been over
to our house lots of times, too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then he’s a puncher, is he?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I reckon he has been ’bout everything
in his day, for I’ve heard him say so,” came the
reply. “He rides with my awful dad, an’ they
seem to git on together, which is some queer,
because most of ’em is that skeered o’ dad they
tries to steer clear o’ him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“My! but this dad of yours must be a grizzly
bear, Amos?” remarked Jimmy, who had been
greatly impressed with what he heard the boy
say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just you wait till you see him, that’s all,”
was what Amos told him. “Mam, she reckons
as how ’twas this same Clem Parsons as had got
dad to ridin’ ’round the kentry doin’ things that
might git him into trouble, an’ she hates him like
pizen, for the same. Since they got to goin’
together, dad he’s allers showing plenty of the
long-green, which he never handled before. But
I ain’t tellin’ fambly secrets, and I reckons I’d
better shut up shop.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He had said enough, however, to convince Ned
and Jack that he strongly suspected his step-father
of having joined forces with a band of
cattle thieves who were stealing the fattest
beeves neighboring ranchers owned, and selling
them on the side.</p>

<p class='c008' >There is always this temptation existing when
cattle are raised on the range, often feeding for
days and weeks many miles away from the ranch
house, and scattered among the little valleys
where the grass grows greenest. In the darkness
of the night, a few of these experienced rustlers
can cut out what they want of a herd, and drive
them far away, effectually concealing the trail.
Then the brands are changed adroitly, and the
cattle shipped away to be sold in a distant
market.</p>

<p class='c008' >So long as this lawless business can be carried
on successfully, it brings in big money to the
reckless rustlers; but if discovered in the act
they are usually treated with scant ceremony by
the angry punchers and shot down like wolves.</p>

<p class='c008' >To some men the fascination of the life causes
them to ignore its perils. Then besides, the fact
that money pours in upon them with so little
effort, is a temptation they are unable to resist.
So long as there are ranches, and cattle to be
raised for the market, there will be men who go
wrong and try to get a fat living off those who
do the work.</p>

<p class='c008' >It did not surprise Ned to learn that this
clever rascal, whom he had been asked to look
up and apprehend if possible, had for the time
being forsaken the counterfeiting game and
started on a new lay. Clem Parsons was no one
idea man. His past fairly bristled with shrewd
devices, whereby he deluded the simple public
and eluded the detectives sent out by the Secret
Service to enmesh him.</p>

<p class='c008' >He had played the part of moonshiner, smuggler,
and bogus moneymaker for years, and
snapped his fingers at the best men on the pay
roll of the Government. Now, if as seemed possible,
he had turned cattle rustler, perhaps there
might come a complete change in the programme;
for if the irate ranchmen and their
faithful punchers only got on a hot trail with
Clem at the other end, the authorities at Washington
might be saved much further anxiety; for
a man who has been strung up to a telegraph
pole and riddled with bullets is not apt to give
any one trouble again.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had learned some important facts that
were apt to prove more or less valuable to him
presently. Already he felt that they had been
paid many times over for the little effort it had
taken to rescue Amos from the sand of the shallow river.</p>

<p class='c008' >Scouts are taught to do a good deed without
any thought of a return; but all the same, it is
pleasant to know that the reward does often
come, and if any of the four chums had failed to
find a chance to turn his badge right-side up
that day, on account of having given a helping
hand to some one, certainly they must feel entitled
to that privilege after lifting Amos out of
his sad predicament. Saving a precious human
life must surely be counted as answering the
requirements of the scout law.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Amos, a little later, left them to saunter
down to the brink of the river, in order to give his
mottled pony a last drink before leaving him at
the end of his rope to crop grass the remainder
of the night, Jack turned to the scout master and
gave expression to his convictions as follows:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, it looks like your old luck holds good,
Ned, and that you stand a chance of running
across your game the very first thing after getting
here. If this Clem Parsons Amos tells us
about turns out to be the same man the Government
wants you to tackle, he’ll be walking into
the net any old time from now on. Why, we
may run across him tomorrow or the day afterwards,
who knows?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s the right party,” said Ned, quietly. “I
asked Amos if he had a scar on his cheek, and he
said it gave Clem a look as though he was grinning
all the time, a sort of sneering expression, I
imagine. And as you say, Jack, I’m in great
luck to strike a hot trail so early in the hunt.
Given the chance, and I’ll have Mr. Clem Parsons
on the way to Los Angeles, by rail, with a
hop, skip and a jump.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s a nifty character, all right,” remarked
Jimmy; “and trains with a hard crowd out here,
so we’ll all have to pitch in and help lift him.
Four of us, armed with rifles as we are, ought
to be enough to flag him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“One thing in our favor,” ventured Jack, “is
that he’ll never for a minute dream of being
afraid of a pack of Boy Scouts. While he might
keep a suspicious eye on every strange man he
meets, and his hand ready to draw a gun, he’ll
hardly give us a second look. That’s where we
can get the bulge on Clem, and his ignorance is
going to be his undoing yet.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Perhaps we’d better be a little careful how
we mention these things while Amos is around,”
Ned went on to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But sure, you don’t think that little runt
would peach on us, do you?” demanded Jimmy,
who had apparently taken a great liking for the
diminutive puncher.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Certainly not,” answered Ned, “but you
understand one of the things that goes to make
a successful Secret Service operator is in knowing
how to keep his own counsel. He’s got to
learn all he can about others, and tell as little
about himself as will carry him through. So
please keep quiet about my wanting to invite
this Clem Parsons to an interview with the
Collector in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy promptly raised his hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m on,” he said. “Mum’s the word till you
lift the embargo, Ned. But it begins to look like
we might have some interestin’ happenings ahead
of us, from what we know about this Clem Parsons,
and what we guess is agoin’ on between the
ranchers and the cattle rustlers. I thought all
the froth had blown off the top, after we quit
that Death Valley, but now I’m beginnin’ to
believe we’re agoin’ to scratch gravel again right
smart. Which suits Jimmy McGraw all right,
because he’s built that way, and never did like
to see the green mould set on top of the pond.
Keep things astirrin’, that’s my way. When
folks go to sleep, give the same a punch, and
start something doin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” said Harry, looking up from his work
close by, “if you have a few more narrow squeaks
like that one to-day up on the mountain trail, it
won’t be long before they plant <i>you</i> under the
daisies,” but Jimmy only laughed at the warning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />AROUND THE CAMP FIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >It was a lovely night, with the moon looking
almost as round as a big yellow cart-wheel when
it rose in the east, where the horizon lay low,
with the level plain and sky meeting.</p>

<p class='c008' >Besides, it was not nearly as hot there on the
plains as they had found it back where the sands
of the Mojave Desert shifted with the terrible
winds that seemed to come from the regions of
everlasting fire, they scorched so.</p>

<p class='c008' >The scouts appeared to be enjoying themselves
so much that even Jimmy, usually the sleepy
member of the party, gave no sign of wanting
to crawl under his brilliant and beloved Navajo
blanket.</p>

<p class='c008' >Near by the three pack animals were tethered,
along with the calico pony owned by Amos.
They cropped the grass as though they could
never get enough of the same. Everything
seemed so very peaceful that one would find it
difficult to imagine that there could come any
change to the scene.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos had joined the circle again, and once
more the conversation had become general. Ned
asked numerous questions concerning the ranch
which they expected to visit, and in this way they
learned in advance considerable about the
puncher gang, some of the peculiarities of various
members of the same, as well as the floating
news of the region.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Amos was asked about the hunting he
gave glowing accounts of the sport to be had by
those willing to ride twenty miles or more to the
coulies of the foothills, where a panther or a
grizzly bear might be run across, and deer were
to be stalked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How about wolves?” Jimmy wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy always declared war on wolves. He
had had some experiences with the treacherous
animals in the past, and could not forget. There
was a standing grudge between them, and every
time Jimmy found a chance he liked to knock
over a gray prowler.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos shrugged his narrow shoulders as though
he took very little stock in such cowardly animals.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! the punchers they have a round-up for
the critters every fall, an’ so you see they kind
of keep ’em low in stock. Then besides, ever
since they took to payin’ a bounty for wolf
scalps, men go out to hunt for the same when
they ain’t got nothin’ else to do. They ain’t
aplenty about this part of the country nowadays.
I reckon as how that’s why Wolf Harkness took
to raisin’ the critters.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s that, raising wolves, do you mean,
Amos? Sure you must be kiddin’?” was the
way Jimmy greeted this announcement.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not me, Jimmy; it’s plain United States
I’m giving you, sure I am,” the other insisted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But there ain’t no great call for wolf pelts,
like there is for black fox and ’coon, and otter,
and skunks and that sort of thing. How d’ye
s’pose this Wolf Harkness makes it pay?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! that’s easy,” replied Amos, carelessly.
“You see, he kills off a certain number of his
stock once in so often and sells the skins. Then
later on they reckon that he collects the bounty
for wolf scalps from the State.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But say, that looks kind of queer for any
man to raise pests, and then expect to make the
State pay him so much for every one he kills,”
Jimmy remarked, shaking his head as though he
found it difficult to believe.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t know how he manages,” the boy continued.
“Heard some say that the law, it left a
loophole for such practices, and that they couldn’t
stop him. Others kind of think he sells the
scalps to some hunter, who collects for the same.
But everybody just knows Harkness does get a
heap of cash out of his queer business.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ever been to his pen and seen his stock?”
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, once I happened that way, but the smell
drove me away. There must have been thirty
or more wolves in the stockade right then, and
they looked like they was pretty nigh starved,
too. I dreamed that night they broke loose and
got me cornered in an empty cabin. I barred
the door, but they pushed underneath and clumb
through the broken windows, and everywhere I
looked I saw red tongues and pale yellow eyes!
Then I woke up, and was scared near stiff, for
there was a pair of eyes in the dark right alongside
me in the loft at home. But say, that
turned out to be only our old black cat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >All of them laughed with Amos, as though
they could fully appreciate the scare he must
have received on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c008' >The subject of the wolf farm seemed to have
interested Jimmy intensely, for he went on asking
more questions concerning the raising of the
animals, what they were fed on, the price of wolf
pelts, and a lot more along the same lines until
finally Harry turned to Ned and complained.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell him to change the subject, won’t you,
Ned? He’ll have the lot of us dreaming we’re
beset by a horde of wolves. And you’d better
make him draw all the charges out of his gun
to-night, because he’s sure to sit up and begin
blazing away, to keep from being dragged off.
Jimmy’s got a big imagination, you know, and
every once in a while it runs away with him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell me,” announced Jimmy, rather indignantly,
“who’s got a better right to be askin’
questions about the habits of the animals than
me, who’s a member of that same Wolf Patrol?
How can you expect a feller to give the right
kind of a <i>howl</i> when he wants to signal to his
mates, unless he finds out all these things.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! if that’s the worst you are after, Jimmy,
go ahead and find out,” Jack was heard to say,
condescendingly. “I thought you had a more
serious scheme in that head of yours than just
accumulating knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy turned and looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And what did you think I had up me sleeve,
if it’s a fair question?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, you see,” began Jack, with a twinkle
in his eye, “I was afraid that you might want to
invest what money you’ve got saved in starting
a wolf ranch of your own, or trying to buy this
old man Harkness out. I supposed that was
why you wanted to know the exact value of wolf
hides, and what the State paid bounty on scalps.
But I’m just as glad to find that you’re not
bothering your head over the business part of
the game. Perhaps you’d like to meet up with
this Harkness, thinking he might give you a
chance to shoot his collection of hungry wolves.
That would be a snap for a fellow who hates
the beasts like you do, and has made a vow to
never let one get past him, when he had a gun
handy or a stone to heave.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy only grinned. He did not know
whether Jack was joking or not, but there
seemed to be something complimentary in his
way of talking; and Jimmy was not at all averse
to being known as a champion wolf killer.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I only hope I get a chance to see this Harkness
and his bunch of slick critters before we
quit this neck of the woods,” he remarked. “But
as I ain’t a butcher you needn’t think that I’d
ask him to let me cut down his list with my new
Marlin gun. Out in the open I’m death on the
sneakers every time; but it’d go against my
grain to knock ’em over, when they hadn’t got
any show for their money. I never could do
the axe business for a chicken at home, even
when we were livin’ in the country.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! well, you must excuse me for speaking
of such a thing, Jimmy,” said Jack, with
assumed gravity; “I was mistaken, that’s all, in
sizing you up. Appearances are often deceitful,
you know, and things don’t always turn out as
they seem. Now, few people looking at you
would ever dream that they were gazing on a
marvelous phenomenon. I guess you caught
that trick from association with Ned, here,” and
Jack might have continued along that vein still
further had he not been nudged sharply by the
scout master, and heard Ned mutter:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mum’s the word, Jack. Don’t tell all you
know!”</p>

<p class='c008' >This brought him to his senses, for he remembered
that there was a stranger present, and that
it had been decided not to expose their full hand
to the gaze of Amos, at least for the present.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this fashion the time passed.</p>

<p class='c008' >All of the scouts were in a humor to vote that
one of the most delightful camps they had ever
been in. Perhaps this partly arose from the
great contrast it afforded when compared with
recent nights passed under the most trying of
conditions, when crossing the desert, and the
terrible valley lying to the east of it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos had a blanket along with him. Apparently
the lad was accustomed to sleeping by
himself on the open plain, and always went prepared.
Things were not as pleasant as they might
be at his cabin home, frequently enough; and
besides this, he must be possessed of a wandering
nature, feeling perfectly satisfied to take care of
himself, and capable of doing it, too.</p>

<p class='c008' >They were still lying around the dying fire,
and each waiting for some one else to take the
lead in mentioning such a thing as going to sleep,
when Amos suddenly sat upright.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned noticed that he had his head cocked on
one side, and appeared to be in the attitude of
listening for a repetition of some sound that may
have struck his acute hearing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There it comes again,” Amos remarked.
“You see, the wind has veered around that way
more or less; but say, twelve miles as the crow
flies is pretty hefty of a distance to hear that
pack give tongue, seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had caught it that time.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You must mean the wolves that Harkness
keeps shut up in his pen for breeding purposes,
is that it, Amos?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nothing more nor less than that,” came the
reply.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, I caught it as plain as anything then!”
acknowledged Jimmy, with a vein of triumph
and satisfaction in his voice, as though he did
not mean to be left at the post, when the whole
bunch was running swiftly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whew! they do make a racket, when they’re
excited, for a fact!” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is it the wolves you’re talking about?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t you be hearing the noise beyond
there?” Jimmy asked him. “P’raps now, meat
is so scarce that the old man’s put his pets on
half rations, and the whoopin’ we hear is meant
for a protest.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, what of that?” Jack wanted to know;
“I guess you’d raise a bigger howl than that,
Jimmy, if we tried to put <i>you</i> on half rations. I
can fancy how you’d be trying to lift the roof
off, and they’d have to call the fire company out
to soak you with their hose so as to make you
stop. But don’t get alarmed, Jimmy, because
none of us have any intention that way.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They sat there and listened for several minutes.
No doubt, Jimmy was endeavoring to
picture in his mind what the den of trapped
wolves must look like; and at the same time, he
was promising himself once more to try and
visit the Harkness place before leaving the
country. He would like to be able to say he
had set eyes on so strange a thing as a wolf ranch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry began to yawn, and stretch tremendously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What ails you fellows; don’t any of you
expect to crawl into your blankets and pick up a
little sleep? Talking may be all very well, but
it doesn’t rest you up any. Ned, why don’t you
tell Jimmy to sound taps, all lights out so the
rest of us can adjourn? As long as Jimmy’s
afloat to do the grand talking act, it isn’t any
use trying to go to sleep, because you just can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy seemed ready to take up that challenge,
and entered upon an argument calculated to
prove that he was a mild mannered individual
alongside of some people he could mention,
though not wanting to give names. Ned, however,
put his foot down.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Harry’s right this time, Jimmy, and you
know it. So make up your mind to simmer
down, and keep the rest for another time. We’ll
find a soft spot and see how well this ground lies.
And we ought to make up some for lost sleep
to-night, with that soft breeze blowing, and the
air getting fresher right along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At that plain invitation Jimmy began to make
his blanket ready, for he never liked seeing any
one crawl in ahead of him any more than he did
to be the first one up in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos still sat there. Ned, looking at the boy,
saw that there was a little frown on his forehead, as
though he did not exactly like something or other.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s wrong, Amos?” he asked, quietly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The breeze, it is no stronger than before, you
can see, Ned,” the kid puncher replied, as he
held up his wet forefinger, after the fashion of
range riders and plainsmen in general.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s true enough,” replied the scout master,
always willing to pick up points in woodcraft,
for he did not pretend to know everything
there was going.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But listen!” added Amos; “it is much louder
now, you see.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned became intensely interested at once.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You are right,” he remarked, “the sound of
that wolfish howling does come three times as
loud as in the start, and yet the wind couldn’t
be the reason of that. Do you know what makes
it, Amos?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I could give a guess, mebbe.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“As how?” continued Ned, while Jack and
Jimmy and Harry all stopped their preparations
for fixing their blankets to suit their
individual wants, in order to hear what the kid
puncher would say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“When I was over there at the wolf ranch,”
Amos commenced, “I remember now that I
noticed the pen looked old and weak. I asked
the hunter about it, and he said it’d hold, he
guessed; that wolves, they didn’t have the intelligence
of hosses, or even cattle, so as to make
a combined rush at a weak place.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well?” Ned remarked, as Amos paused.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It might be that somethin’ happened to make
that weak place in the big pen give way, and the
whole pack is loose, acomin’ for the river, hungry
as all get-out, and ready to attack anything that
walks on two legs, because they are nearly
starved!”</p>

<p class='c008' >When Amos gave this as his opinion, the scouts
who had been getting their blankets ready for a
quiet night’s sleep seemed suddenly to lose all
interest in the proceedings. Instead Jimmy
started reaching around him for that new Marlin
repeating rifle, which had already proven its
worth on several occasions.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whew!” they could hear him saying, almost
breathlessly to himself; “thirty hungry wolves,
all at a pop, hey? That’s what I call crowding
the mourners. I may be set on knockin’ over
an occasional critter when I run across the same;
but say, I ain’t so greedy as all that. Think I’m
in the wholesale line, do you? Well, you’ve got
another guess acomin’ to you, that’s all!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />THE WOLF PACK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“What can we do, Ned?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was not the only one now who had
seized hold of his gun, for the other three scouts
could be seen gripping their rifles. Only poor
Amos was without his rifle, though he carried a
revolver, cowboy fashion, attached to his belt.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s out of the question for us to get away,”
replied the scout master; “because we only have
three poor burros, and they’d be overtaken before
they’d gone a mile.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” added Jimmy, “and don’t forget
there’s four of us, Ned, darlint.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Amos could skip out if he feels like it, because
his pony has fleet heels, and might outrun
the wolf pack?” Jack suggested.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But all the same Amos is agoin’ to hang
around, and take pot luck with the rest of the
bunch,” remarked the kid puncher, quietly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But how about the animals,” asked Harry,
nervously; “do we leave them to be pulled down
by the savage beasts of prey? All of us could
shinny up some of these trees, but burros can’t
climb.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh, I’ve seen the time when I thought they
could do everything but fly,” grunted Jimmy;
“and I wasn’t so sure about that, either.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We might bring them in close and stand
guard over the poor things,” Ned went on to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that they hurried to where the four animals
were tethered. Already something seemed to
have told the burros and the calico pony that
danger hovered in that breeze, for they were
beginning to show signs of excitement, and it
was not such an easy job after all to lead them
in close to the dying camp fire.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hastily they were firmly secured.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Will the ropes hold if they get to cutting up?”
Harry asked, after he had tied his as many as
five different times, to make sure there would be
no slipping of the knot.</p>

<p class='c008' >“They are all good and practically new,” Ned
informed him, “and I think there’s no doubt
about their holding. Now to get ourselves fixed.
Pick your tree, everybody, but let it be where
you can keep watch over the animals, so as to
knock over every wolf that makes a jump for
them.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They caught on to the idea Ned had in mind.
This was to occupy, say as many as three
trees that chanced to grow in a triangle around
the fire and the spot where the burros and pony
had been fastened.</p>

<p class='c008' >The bright moon would give them all needed
opportunity to see any movement on the part
of the assailants, and woe to the daring wolf
that ventured to cross the dead line.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned waited to see which trees the others would
pick out before choosing his own place of refuge.
He did this because he thought it good policy to
have their forces scattered, as by that means
they could guard the camp more surely.</p>

<p class='c008' >As they went on with these preparations,
looking to the repulse of invading hosts of sleek
gray-coated beasts of prey, they could hear the
fiendish chorus of wolfish howls drawing steadily
nearer all the while. There may have been a
lingering doubt in the mind of Jack or Harry
concerning the accuracy of that guess on the
part of Amos, but it was gone by this time.
Those constantly increasing howls had convinced
them beyond all question.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy had picked out his tree easily enough.
Indeed, it was a habit of his these times to settle
in his mind just what tree would make the best
harbor of refuge in case of a sudden necessity.
This he always did as soon as a camp had been
decided upon. Jimmy was wont to say with
considerable pride that he was only following
out the customary scout law “be prepared,”
which might cover the case, as it does many
others.</p>

<p class='c008' >He seemed to have little trouble about
climbing into this tree, first pushing up his Marlin
gun, and then the beloved Navajo blanket with
its bright colors; for Jimmy did not mean to
leave his personal possessions to the mercy of
the thievish pack that had broken bounds and
was wildly hunting for food.</p>

<p class='c008' >He climbed after the rest, and it happened
that no one else had picked on that particular
tree for their refuge, so that Jimmy was going
to have it all to himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >The lower limbs grew rather close to the
ground, Jimmy now realized; and he began to
wonder whether he had after all been wise in
choosing such a tree. Would he be in any danger
from the sharp teeth and claws of the wolves
when they came rushing up? Jimmy did not
believe that wolves could climb trees; but all
the same he did not feel altogether easy about it.
Still, when he found himself clutching his trusty
gun new confidence seemed to be born in his
soul.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let ’em come if they want to,” he said aloud,
between his set teeth. “If they will have it, I
guess I’ll be able to take care of the lot. Every
bullet ought to count for a victim; and, mebbe,
now I’ll be able to see if the bully gun can’t send
the lead through a couple at one time. It’s
passed through a six-inch tree, and that’s goin’
some, let me tell you. My stars! but don’t they
yap to beat the band. And say, they can’t be
more’n a mile away right now, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The thought was enough to make his blood
leap through his veins with renewed excitement.
In imagination, Jimmy already began to picture
himself blazing away as fast as he could work the
mechanism of his modern firearm; and, of
course, bowling over a fresh victim with every
discharge.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jimmy!”</p>

<p class='c008' >That was Harry calling.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hello, there!” replied the one addressed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you think to grab up the grub and take
it up with you?” continued Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! thunder!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was all broken up by this sudden
intelligence. The others had apparently expected
him to look out for the food supply, because
Jimmy was always ready to take this burden on
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008' >And now, alas, what had seemed to be everyone’s
duty had proved to be no one’s; their
precious supply of food was left unguarded at
the foot of that central tree, close to which the
burros and pony had been hitched.</p>

<p class='c008' >Could he reach it, and get back before the
advance gray runner arrived on the scene, bringing
his appetite with him and, likewise, his teeth
well sharpened for business?</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy came to a conclusion almost instantly,
and having a convenient crotch in which he
could leave his gun and blanket, he dropped
down from his perch.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hey! get back there!” shouted Jack; “don’t
you hear the pack coming along? They’ll get
you, Jimmy! Climb up again!”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Jimmy, undismayed, was already making
a bolt for the spot where he could see the pack
he knew contained pretty much all the food
they had left. He had to face one of two evils;
and to Jimmy’s mind, it was far worse to run
the chances of being starved to death than to
accept the risk of the wolves coming up before
he could climb into his tree of refuge again.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy knew what it was to suffer the pangs
of hunger; and as he had never yet been bitten
by wolves, he decided according to his light.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was surely need of haste, as he knew
while bending over the package which he meant
to save. The clamor of wolfish tongues was very
close at hand, and with what seemed to be a full
dozen joining in the yelping orgy it certainly
went to make up a fiendish noise.</p>

<p class='c008' >He could hear the rush of jumping forms
through the underbrush as though those eager
animals had already scented what they considered
their prey, and were straining every nerve
in the endeavor to beat each other to the spot.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy in turning after securing the bundle
had the misfortune to catch his left foot in a
projecting root and fall headlong. He felt a
thrill of horror, under the impression that his
foot might be gripped fast in the upturned root,
and that he would be held in this position until
the bounding beasts had reached him, no matter
how the other boys poured in a hot fire.</p>

<p class='c008' >But it was not so bad as that, and when he
started to scramble to his feet again, Jimmy
found that he could move all right.</p>

<p class='c008' >He could have made much faster time had he
obeyed the order which Ned called out to him,
to abandon the packet and make for his tree
haven with all speed. But there was that old
spirit of obstinacy urging Jimmy to hold what
he had, to the bitter end. What would he think
of himself in times to come if he remembered
that he had tamely submitted to conditions
that were not of his own making and abandoned
the entire visible food supply for himself and
friends to those savage half-famished creatures?</p>

<p class='c008' >On gaining his feet Jimmy again headed for his
tree, gripping the bundle with both arms. That
was a sight the other boys would not soon forget;
but Ned was not very much surprised, for he knew
the nature of his assistant, and had on other occasions
witnessed just such specimens of his grit.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Drop it, Jimmy!” shrieked Harry, afraid
that something terrible was about to follow this
action on the part of the other scout, because
the rush of the coming wolves had increased to
a pitch that was next door to terrible.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t do it, Jimmy; we’ll hedge you in, all
right! Bully boy, Jimmy!” Jack was calling out,
for Jack, being much more of a fighter than
Harry, could better appreciate the daring feat
Jimmy was carrying to a successful end.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned did not venture to say anything. He
knew the weakness of Jimmy, and how easily
he could be “rattled” when others were shouting
conflicting appeals to him. And so Ned contented
himself with sitting there, holding his
gun ready for work and keeping a close watch, so
as to discover the very first sign of the leading
wolf of the coming pack.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was now at his tree, but the next
thing was to get the package of food safely lodged
up among the limbs, where they formed crotches
at the junction with the main trunk.</p>

<p class='c008' >He tossed it upwards, but was compelled to
stretch out his hands and catch it again, pretty
much as an eager football player might smother
the pigskin oval in his arms on occasion. That
wasted just so many seconds, but although he
heard the rushing sound coming steadily toward
him, Jimmy was game to the core, and would
not allow himself to think of giving up his part
in the play.</p>

<p class='c008' >A second time did he give the packet a toss,
and this effort had more steam back of it, for
the object of his attention went considerably
higher. It must have struck a limb, for it
rebounded back, and once again landed at the
feet of Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >He saw a flitting figure shoot across a little
open spot where the moon’s rays fell upon the
ground; and Jimmy knew full well that this
must be the leading wolf, heading straight toward
him, through the instinct that draws
carniverous animals directly to their intended
prey.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nevertheless, he bent down and deliberately
took the package of food in his possession once
more, meaning to give a third trial, possibly
under the belief that two good attempts deserve
another.</p>

<p class='c008' >This time luck did follow his effort. The
packet managed to lodge somewhere among the
branches, for certainly it failed to fall back again.
And so Jimmy felt that having vindicated his
reputation for courage, it was now up to him to
look out for himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >So he commenced to climb. Jimmy had never
been one of the best climbers in the troop; for
there were quite a number who could, as he
would have said, “cut circles all around” him
in the tree-tops. But this was a case where he
was encouraged to exert himself to the utmost.
There was something worth while at stake, for
should those famished creatures ever reach him,
he might expect them to make short work of
their task.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy under other conditions would doubtless
have climbed that tree more gracefully, but he
could certainly not have done it in less time than
on that present occasion. Speed was everything
to him just then, and he was willing to sacrifice
agility, grace and make-believe coolness to the
one object of avoiding too close acquaintance
with the cruel fangs, which he knew must already
be snapping and grinding in anticipation of a feast.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once he slipped and came very near falling
back to the ground. He felt a cold chill pass
through his whole frame at the bare horror of
the thing; then his grip held its own, and he
managed to give one more desperate heave that
landed him up in the first crotch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even there he was not safe. It was too near
the ground, and one of those agile jumpers might
easily spring that high, with half an effort. So
Jimmy, without even waiting to catch a fresh
breath, put the spurs in and made another heave.</p>

<p class='c008' >He had an indistinct view of some object flashing
toward his tree, more like a streak of light
than a living creature. It must be that leading
wolf, crazy to be the first to seize upon the prey
they had scented from afar.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy might have shouted at the beast, in
hopes of sending him back in alarm; but, in the
first place, he did not have much breath left
with which to engineer such a programme. Then
again he was not given half a show. Not that
the wolf sprang up, and took hold of his shins,
that being the part of Jimmy’s anatomy extending
further down the tree than any other. Oh!
no, such a catastrophe did not happen at all,
because there was no chance that it could with
such vigilant guardians near at hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had, meanwhile, sung out something to
his other two chums. This was in the nature of
the “I’ve got it!” of the fielder, when a high fly
comes his way; for he wants to warn his neighbors
in due time, so that they may not interfere
with his play and make a mess of it all.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Jimmy heard the sharp report of that
rifle so close at hand, his heart felt glad within
him; for he guessed who had pulled the trigger,
and his faith in Ned’s marksmanship was very
great.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How’s that, Mr. Umpire?” he managed to
call, shrilly; and Jack, apparently entering into
the spirit of the thing, was heard to bawl lustily
back, as though the appeal had been directed to
him personally:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Out at first!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Next batter up!” yipped little Amos; which
was enough to tell the scouts that the great
National game was no mystery to this diminutive
cow-puncher, with the face and body of a child,
but the head of a grown person.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then the fun suddenly became fast and furious.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />EVERYBODY BUSY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“My turn next!” shouted Jack, as a further
rushing sound announced the arrival of a second
detachment of the escaped wolfish horde.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had his shooting eye at its best when he
sent the first leaden pellet toward that leading
sprinter. The beast had come with a furious
rush, and chanced to pass through a succession
of shadowy patches, so that the scout master
could not pull the trigger as quickly as he might
have wished. The wolf had actually made one
wild leap upward after Jimmy’s retreating and
plump form before the crash of the gun came.</p>

<p class='c008' >It happened that Jimmy was looking back
over his shoulder at the time, though he knew
that must be a foolish thing to do, and cost many
a fleeing hunter dear. He would not soon forget
the picture that met his eyes, as that gaunt gray
pirate of the herd came rising toward him with
that splendid bound.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why,” Jimmy was heard to say afterwards,
when the shock of battle was a thing only of
memory, “both his lamps looked like yellow
fires, and that red tongue hung from his mouth,
while I could see his long white fangs bared to
beat the band. Then I heard the bang of Ned’s
gun, and that wolf fell back in a heap. When I
saw the way he lay crunched up at the foot of
my tree, I knew he’d gone and croaked. Gee
whiz! but that was a pretty close shave for
Jimmy McGraw, let me tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack got his turn and he found it no easy task
to knock over a leaping wolf, as glimpsed in the
deceptive light. The moon’s rays dazzled his
eyes, and when he saw the newcomer flashing
through the bars of light and shade Jack pulled
the trigger with no assurance that he had held
positively on his target.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was true that the beast took a header, which
proved that he must have been hit by the bullet;
but, even as Jack’s nervous hands started to
pump another cartridge from the magazine into
the firing chamber of his rifle, he saw his intended
victim scramble to its feet, utter one long howl,
and then start to slink away.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No you don’t there; just hold on a bit!”
cried Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >In his excitement, he fumbled more than he
should with the mechanism of his gun, and thus
lost a couple of precious seconds. Indeed, the
wounded wolf might have vanished from view
amidst the brush, only that Harry took it upon
himself to “put his oar in,” with the result that
the bombarded beast crumpled up.</p>

<p class='c008' >By that time even Jimmy was ready for business,
having managed to snatch up his Marlin,
and then look eagerly around for some target at
which to fire.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t forget the directions!”</p>

<p class='c008' >That was Ned calling out. He knew the value
of economizing ammunition when far from a
base of supply; and, consequently, did not want
the others to needlessly do anything of this sort.
One bit of lead ought to be enough for each
beast, if properly delivered.</p>

<p class='c008' >This warning was really meant more for Jimmy
than either of the others; for he had been
known to get tremendously excited on other
occasions, when peril threatened, and mix things
up considerably.</p>

<p class='c008' >As everybody had had a shot but Jimmy, it
was now his turn, according to the order of
events which had been arranged. Jack recognized
this fact by advising him to “be prepared”
as a true scout always should.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here they come with a whoop!” Amos was
heard to exclaim, as there came a louder rush
through the brushwood than at any previous
time, proving that quite a bunch of the hungry
animals must be at hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Steady, Jimmy, and be quick to pick your
game!” called Ned, thinking to thus keep the
other from getting “rattled.”</p>

<p class='c008' >From the furious way in which the balance of
the pack was coming on, it seemed evident that
they did not realize what sort of a surprise
awaited them near the river bank. Hunger and
a keen scent was doing the business for them.
They appeared to know that there was something
worth while in the eating line around that
particular part of the country, and evidently
meant to make a bold bid for the same, regardless
of consequences.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was straining his eyes to discover the
first sign of the oncoming pack. He had his
faithful repeater up against his shoulder and was
aiming at the spot he believed would speedily be
occupied by a leaping wolf.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was no sharpshooter, though he had
done some fairly creditable work along the line
of knocking over game in times past. As a rule,
he preferred shooting at random into a bunch of
quail and taking chances of making a fine bag.
So now he indulged in the hope that several of
the wolves would break cover in a heap, when
he could just blaze away and, perhaps, knock
over a couple with one shot; which he fancied
would put a feather in his hat as a marksman
who knew how to conserve his ammunition.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then the time came to fire. He could see a
confused mass tearing along through the spaces
where those bars of light and shadow rather
dazzled the eye; and, not daring to wait any
longer, Jimmy let fly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hurroo! did you see that beggar roll over?
And listen to the other howl, like he had the
toothache, and no dentist within twenty miles!
Tell me about that, will you? Soak it to ’em,
fellers, good and plenty!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, all this was pretty much lost, because,
what with the racket created by howling,
yelping and yapping wolves, and the banging of
the guns in the hands of the scouts, a din had
started that made it impossible to hear any single
human voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy realized that if he wanted to have a
further share in the disposal of the savage pack,
he had better be getting busy again. So he up
with his rifle, and looked eagerly for some target
at which he could fire.</p>

<p class='c008' >There never could be a more exciting affair
than that battle with the escaped wolves that
Harkness, the herder, had been feeding and
keeping for breeding purposes. They were far
from tamed by their recent confinement; indeed,
Ned could not remember ever having run across
a more savage pack in all his experience.</p>

<p class='c008' >Afterwards, in commenting on this strange
fact, he came to the conclusion that it was caused
by a combination of two things: the animals
had not been fed recently, and were almost crazy
for food; and then, he learned that Harkness
had ever been a cruel despot, using a black-snake
whip with a long cutting lash to quiet his pack in
their enclosure, whenever their howling annoyed
him—always keeping well out of the reach of
their fangs when plying the whip, it may be
understood; for he had a species of “pulpit”
built out far above the pen, in which he was free
to swing that instrument of keen torture.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was just slaughter, for the wretched wolves
really had no chance at all to retaliate. Ned
sickened of the business quickly, but what could
they do otherwise? It was a condition that had
been forced upon them. They had not invited
the attack, and must defend themselves against
the pack, no matter at what cost.</p>

<p class='c008' >Before long there were dead and dying wolves
lying all around, as “thick as blackberries in the
good old summertime,” as Jimmy put it. Others
that had received wounds, and no longer felt the
same furious desire to try conclusions with the
enemies perched beyond their reach in the trees,
began to slink away. Doubtless, they remembered
old lairs in the distant hills to which they
might fly; and, in some fashion, supply themselves
with the necessary food, without taking
such desperate chances.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All gone, it looks like, Ned!” sang out Jack,
“and just when I’ve gone and got the magazine
of my gun charged again, too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Set ’em up in the other alley!” cried Jimmy.
“I accounted for some of the victims, you can
roll your hoop on that!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“My stars! but that <i>was</i> a warm session!”
exclaimed Harry; “and I wonder now if you got
any sort of picture, Jack, when you used your
flashlight on the scrimmage?”</p>

<p class='c008' >That was just what Jack had done, laid his
rifle aside for a minute, and made a good use of
his camera, prepared for the occasion. The sudden
flare of the cartridge had illuminated the
scene as might a flash of lightning; and, possibly,
this had been one of the causes that frightened
the balance of the pack away, for the attack
weakened from that moment.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dast we get down now?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >While he was speaking, Amos Adams dropped
from his perch, as though he could see no further
reason for playing the part of a bird and perching
there among the branches.</p>

<p class='c008' >During the racket Ned had several times
heard the lighter report of a six-shooter, and
understood that the kid cow-puncher was trying
to do his share of the work in diminishing the
number of Harkness’ pets. Whether success
followed his efforts or not, Ned was unable to
say, though he imagined the boy knew how to
shoot the gun he “toted” in the holster at his
belt.</p>

<p class='c008' >As there was no reappearance of the wolves,
the rest of the campers came down. The burros
and the calico pony had acted as though frantic
during the melee; but, as the boys had made
sure to secure them properly, they were all there
and by degrees quieting down, when they found
that they were not going to be made a meal of by
those savage beasts of prey.</p>

<p class='c008' >The scouts counted just thirteen dead wolves
scattered about. Two others were trying to
crawl away, dragging their broken limbs after
them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We must knock those fellows on the head,”
said Ned; “because they’ll die anyway, and it’s
the duty of a scout to put an end to needless
pain.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Although he had already had more than
enough of the slaughter, Ned followed after the
two escaping animals. They showed their
venomous natures by turning on him and snarling
furiously; but Ned stopped far enough away
not to endanger himself from those glistening
fangs exposed when the red lips were drawn back.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two quick shots did the business, and then
there were fifteen.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh! Harkness’ game is about up this time,
and he won’t raise any more young wolves to
sell the skins for lap-robes and turn over the
scalps to the State for bounty money,” Jack
observed, as they all gathered again near the
fire, which was started up afresh; for they could
not think of such a thing as sleep for some little
time, after so much excitement.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If there’s even two dollars apiece, it would
net a feller thirty plunks right now, to raise the
hair of this bunch,” speculated Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But we don’t want to go into the wolf scalping
business, do we, Ned?” expostulated Harry,
who viewed the idea with considerable disgust.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Certainly not,” replied the scout master.
“Let Harkness come and get his property if he
wants, for all of us. We’ve saved him all the
trouble of cleaning up his pack. He ought to
thank us for it; but, if what Amos here says
about him is true, I don’t believe he will.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” said Jack, frowning, “he’d better not
get too gay and try to blame us for cleaning out
the pack, because we won’t stand any abuse.
It was a case of give and take. They meant to
pull us down and make a fine meal; and they
got what was coming to them. Harkness had
better go slow how he complains.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I was wondering,” mused Ned, as he settled
down comfortably again, just as though nothing
worth mentioning had happened to disturb him,
“whether anything had come to Harkness?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How could there?” demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! of course, I don’t know, but then it might
be the wolves had caught him off his guard and
torn him to pieces before they skipped out. If
we have time, perhaps we ought to go around
that way and see if there’s anything wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The others did not seem to look at it in the
same light that Ned was doing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A waste of time, Ned,” Jack declared, vehemently.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I say,” added Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can’t see what it matters to us whether the
old rascal has been hoisted by his own infernal
machine or not!” grumbled Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But don’t forget that we’re scouts,” Ned
continued impressively, “and that we ought to
follow the scout law which teaches us to do good,
even to our enemies, if the chance opens up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“After we’ve licked the same good and plenty,
I admit,” Jimmy spoke up, with one of his
famous grins decorating his freckled face and a
twinkle in his eye. “P’raps you’re right, Ned;
and, as we’ve upset the old man’s business, we
could call that a lickin’ and let her go at that.
If you’re of the same mind in the mornin’, tell
me. But say, I b’lieve I could snatch a few
winks right now, since things have calmed
down.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Save for the distant mournful howling of
several of the hungry wolves nothing was to be
heard all around them. So after arranging for
keeping “watch and watch,” the scouts turned
in. Amos snuggled down alongside them; while
Jack, upon whom had fallen the choice for the
first spell at playing sentry, settled his back up
against a tree, laid his ready gun across his
knees, and prepared to do his duty.</p>

<p class='c008' >The fire burned brightly for a long time and
Jack sat there thinking of many things connected
with both the past and the immediate
future. Doubtless, he felt that it began to look
as though they were not yet through with hazards
and adventures on this trip, when, on what
was practically their first night out on the open
plain, they had been so savagely beset by Harkness’
escaped wolf pack.</p>

<p class='c008' >By degrees even the distant howling of the
few survivors died away, as they no doubt
started for the distant mountains, afraid to come
back to the scene of the recent carnage, even
though the scent of blood must have tempted
them dreadfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy had gone to sleep immediately he lay
down, for he never knew the time when he could
not forget his troubles in sweet slumber. Once
or twice he managed to get on his back and
aroused Ned by his heavy breathing. On these
occasions the scout master was in the habit of
giving the offender a sharp punch in the ribs
and it seemed as though Jimmy understood what
was wanted, even in his sleep, for he would
inevitably turn over on his side.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had just been through the third experience
of this kind and was wondering whether he
had not better suggest that they always tie
Jimmy in a certain position as he lay down to
sleep, when he heard a voice close by.</p>

<p class='c008' >As Ned instantly sat up he recognized the
tones as belonging to Pard Jack, who was evidently
laying down the law to some party:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold up your hands, you there in the bushes,
and step right up to the fire, or I’ll shoot; and,
let me tell you, this gun goes straight! Lively
now, Mister, and no foolishness! Oh! Ned!
come here, will you? We’ve got a visitor!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />AN UNWELCOME GUEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >When Ned started toward the spot where he
knew Jack was on guard, he could hear Harry
groping for his rifle, and this told him the other
would also be close on his heels. Harry, finding
that Jimmy still slumbered peacefully, managed
to give him a severe poke in the ribs as he passed
that had an immediate effect.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here, who’s doin’ that now?” broke from
Jimmy’s lips, and then, no doubt, he suddenly
realized that there was something up, for he
saw Ned poking the fire, holding his gun in the
other hand, and Harry also standing erect,
armed in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c008' >Accordingly, Jimmy made haste to discover
his gun and follow after them. In the meantime,
the dusky figure among the bushes which
Jack was covering had stood erect and started
to advance toward the fire, as ordered, holding
his hands high above his head.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s Harkness!” cried out the kid puncher,
who had been on his feet about as soon as Ned;
and, somehow, no one was much surprised at the
information thus conveyed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned saw that Harkness was just about such a
looking man as one might picture if asked to
describe a wolf-raiser. He had grayish hair and
a scraggy beard; his face was ugly, and his eyes,
like those of a rat for keenness and audacity.
Taken in all, he was as tough looking a character
as the scouts had run across in many a day.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wot d’ye mean a holdin’ a man up thisaway,
when he jest natrally draps in to arsk who killed
them pets o’ his’n?” the wolf-herder blurted out,
though careful not to take his hands down, for
he knew that Jack was still covering him with
that dangerous looking repeating rifle, and there
was an air of business about the weapon that
warned him not to get careless.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! you can lower your hands now, if you
want,” Jack sang out, “because we’re all on deck
and could riddle your hide with lead if you tried
to use your gun. So just take things easy now,
Mr. Harkness, if that’s your name.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It air!” growled the man, staring hard at
each boy in turn, as though he did not know
what to make of their khaki uniforms and was
a little afraid he had run up against a detachment
of United States regulars.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And I reckon then that all these dead wolves
belonged to you?” Ned went on to remark, as he
swept his hand around.</p>

<p class='c008' >The man said something hard under his
breath.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ye gone an’ busted up my bizness, thet’s
wot ye done, w’en ye laid out tuh kill the animiles!”
he complained, as he gritted his yellow
teeth very much as one of the wounded wolves
had done at Ned’s approach.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That couldn’t be helped, Harkness,” the
scout master told him. “Your wolves had
broken out, and you couldn’t expect to ever
trap many of them again, at the best. They
came at us like fury, and we had to defend ourselves,
or we’d have been torn to pieces like a
flash. And that’s why this happened. We
weren’t out hunting for trouble; but you’ve lost
you pack on account of a weak place in your
pen.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But ain’t yuh meanin’ tuh pay me anything
fo’ shootin’ up my pets thisaways?” Harkness
demanded, trying to look fierce, though keeping
an eye on Jack with his ready gun.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy laughed out very loud.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Would you be after hearing the nerve of him,
fellers?” he exclaimed in derision. ’Tis meself
that thinks it sounds like adding insult to injury.
After lettin’ the pack loose to make a square
meal from us, then askin’ pay, because we had
to fight to save our precious lives. ’Tis a rare
joke, it is—not on your tintype, Mister Harkness.
Our principle is ‘millions for defense, not
a plunk for tribute.’ So put that in your pipe
and smoke it.“</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’ve got a lot of assurance, Harkness,”
Ned told him, severely, “to think of asking such
a thing. Why, the boot is on the other foot, and
we ought to be demanding that you pay us back
for all the ammunition it took to clean up your
pack for you. I’m half inclined to believe we
could prosecute you for keeping such a lot of
savage animals. You’d be wise to go mighty
slow about trying to make trouble for any of us.
We might take a notion to run you in.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The man’s whole demeanor changed when he
discovered that his bluster was not going to
alarm the scouts.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I hopes now,” he went on to say in a whining
tone, “thet yuh won’t keep me from taking the
pelts off my poor pets. They’s worth sumpin’
tuh me, likewise the scalps o’ the same. I been
bankin’ on thet money this long time. Hit’s all
I got tuh see me through the winter. Don’t be
too hard on me, gents. I’m out o’ the wolf
raisin’ line fo’ keeps, arter this bust-up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned consulted with his chums for a minute or
two and then turned again to the intruder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here’s what we propose to have you do,
Harkness,” he remarked, with such an air of
finality that the man knew he must yield to circumstances,
“hand over that gun of yours to me;
you’ll get it again in the morning, when we break
camp. Then lie down and go to sleep. One of
us will be on the watch all the time, so if you
try any monkey-doodle business, as Jimmy here
would call it, better go slow, or something will
happen. Do you understand that, Harkness?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The man’s ugly face grew as black as a thunder
cloud, and then with an effort he tried to grin,
though it only added to his unsavory appearance.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Thar be times w’en a feller has tuh eat crow
an’ I reckons as how this be sech a time fo’ me,
younker,” he said, slowly. “Oh! I hain’t no
’jections tuh stayin’ hyar alongside the fire;
but I hopes as how yuh’ll let me hev my pelts
w’en mo’nin’ comes ’long.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, we’ll agree to that and, if you behave,
you can take your property after we clear out in
the morning. Perhaps we’ll go so far as to invite
you to breakfast, too, in the bargain, Harkness,
to show that we have no bad feelings because
your pack made us have a pretty hot
session to-night. So that’s settled. Your gun,
please.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The wolf-herder handed it over, though with
an ill grace. No doubt, he was what they call a
“bad man” down in the Southwest, and this
thing of being made a prisoner by a parcel of
half-grown boys, as it seemed, galled him greatly.</p>

<p class='c008' >After that he dropped down near the fire,
clasped both arms about his knees and stared
moodily into the flames.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jack, seems to me you’ve outstayed the
time limit we set,” Ned suggested, after taking a
quick look up to where the moon was sailing
through a star-decked sky; for scouts early
learn to tell time from the positions of heavenly
bodies, and the setting of a star will be almost as
sure an indication that a certain hour has arrived
as though a watch had been consulted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! well, I thought you seemed to be sleeping
so sound that I’d let it run on a little,” the other
made answer, for Jack was as generous as they
make boys, “and then, you see, I got interested
watching <i>him</i> come creeping along like a snake,
stopping every minute to examine one of the
dead wolves, and saying something to himself
each time, like he kept getting madder and
madder.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I’m going on duty now, Jack, so just
crawl over to your blanket and turn in,” said
Ned, in his quiet but positive way.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos was hovering near him at the time, as
though he wanted to say a few words on the sly.
He found the chance when Ned sat down, also
leaning against the same tree that had supported
the other vidette.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wouldn’t think too much about hurtin’ the
feelings of that old mule-skinner if I was you,
Ned,” the kid cow-puncher went on to say, “he
ain’t near so mad as he puts on. Why, if it hadn’t
been for you and the rest, he’d never got a single
pelt of all that pack. They were free and would a
got clear away, if we hadn’t rounded the same
up here. Fifteen hides, and as many scalps, he
gets, without wasting his ammunition. He’s putting
on—that’s what. But keep an eye out for
him, Ned. That was a smart trick to take his
gun away; but you’ve only scotched the snake,
not killed it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned promised that he would watch the wolf-herder
closely and not allow him to make any
sort of suspicious move.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t think he means to try any funny
business, though,” he added. “You see he
stands to lose all his pelts if he pulls his freight
and gives us the good-bye sign. And with five
against him, the odds are too big; for a boy with
a rifle can be just as dangerous as a full-grown
man.”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was somewhere near one o’clock at the time
of the alarm. The moon was high up in the
heavens and even starting down her road toward
the western horizon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned kept watch and ward diligently. He did
not mean to be caught napping by any unsuspected
circumstance. It was hardly likely that
Harkness could have any allies near by. Ned
had been particular in asking about that, and
Amos assured him that so far as he knew, the
wolf-herder conducted his business alone, shunning
the society of others, save on rare occasions
when he came to town for a spree.</p>

<p class='c008' >The night passed away without anything else
happening to disturb the sleep of Jimmy. Harry
awoke later on and insisted on taking his turn
at keeping watch; so Ned secured his blanket
and lay down close to him, having impressed it
on Harry’s mind that, at the least sign of a movement
on the part of Harkness, he was to reach
out a hand and shake him.</p>

<p class='c008' >But just as Ned had said, the wolf man must
have figured it out that he had everything to
gain and nothing to lose by staying where he
was and waiting for the boys to break camp,
when his gun would be returned and himself
left at liberty to rid those dead animals of their
shaggy gray coats.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was thoughtful to cook enough breakfast
for an extra mouth, and so Harkness was
given his full share of coffee, bacon, and fried
potatoes, as well as all the crackers he could eat.</p>

<p class='c008' >He said little or nothing, unless some question
happened to be fired his way, when he would
make a curt answer. All the while he kept his
ears open and eyed the boys in a suspicious way,
as though disturbed by their presence in the
neighborhood. Those suits of khaki evidently
puzzled Harkness, who could never have run
across Boy Scouts before and knew nothing
about their ways.</p>

<p class='c008' >Noticing these looks on his part, and how he
appeared to be listening intently, as though
desirous of picking up certain information that
might prove of value to him later on, Ned
cautioned his chums against speaking of their
affairs. This he managed to do, through certain
gestures and nods, when the man’s eyes happened
to be turned in another direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >Later on they made ready to pull up stakes and
once more start on their journey toward the cattle
ranch, which they expected to reach before
sunset on this same day.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harkness was eagerly waiting to be handed
his gun, which Ned had taken the trouble to
unload while it was in his possession. There
was not much chance that the man would dare
fire upon them, since he knew what the result
would be and how apt to prove unpleasant for
a fellow of his size; but, then, Ned believed in
taking all precautions possible, and he certainly
did not like the looks of that heavy face with its
rat-like eyes, which Jimmy compared with the
glittering orbs of a pet ferret he had at home.</p>

<p class='c008' >He had already been busily engaged removing
the hides of the slain wolves and seemed to be
willing to accept what the fates had given him.
All the same, Ned believed he was a treacherous
character who would betray his best friend for
a money consideration, and he did not mean to
trust him too far.</p>

<p class='c008' >When everything had been packed and they
were ready to depart, Ned laid the rusty gun of
the wolf-herder on the ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There’s your property, Harkness,” he remarked
casually, “just as I promised. And I
want to say in parting company with you, that
I think you’re lucky to get about half your pelts,
after losing the whole outfit. Of course, we don’t
expect you to thank us for saving half a loaf;
but we’ll be looking back as we leave here to see
how you get on. And, Harkness, I wouldn’t be
in any too big a hurry to step over to where I
laid your gun. So-long!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The man said never a word in reply but if
looks could kill, surely Ned must have met his finish
then and there, to judge from the black scowl
that settled on the heavy face of the wolf man.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this fashion, then, they started out on what
they hoped would be their last day’s journey
before arriving at the ranch of Harry’s uncle.
All of the scouts seemed to be feeling particularly
merry on this bright morning. Perhaps it was
because of the clever way in which they had
escaped from the many perils that had lain in
wait to ambush them since leaving the Coast.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’re well out of gunshot distance by now,”
observed Jack, “and he’s still working with his
pelts, so it doesn’t seem as though we’d have
any trouble with that Harkness. Of all the
tough looking characters I’ve ever run across,
he sure takes the cake. I don’t believe there
could be anything worse made.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At that Amos was heard to chuckle.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! you think so, do you, Jack?” he remarked
with lofty scorn, “just wait till you
glimpse my awful dad, and then you can talk.
He’s a holy terror! Why, even the yellow curs
in the town streets take to running with their
tails between their hind legs when they see him
coming along. His looks and his fog-horn voice
have carried him through many a tight place;
but there’s one hole he always sticks in. My
dad is as good as a whole regiment, to make men
shake in their boots; but—” and again did the
kid puncher pause in that strange way, while a
mysterious smile crept over his dark face, as
though certain recollections gave him more or
less amusement.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned’s curiosity had been aroused to a mild
extent, but he would not ask questions, preferring
to wait for time to unravel the mystery
connected with these vague hints on the part of
Amos Adams.</p>

<p class='c008' >A short time later and they had lost all track
of the previous night’s camp in the hazy distance.
And from that time forward, the scouts
were interested only in what lay ahead; for
somewhere far off they knew was to be found the
cattle ranch to which they were bound and
where a warm welcome, undoubtedly, awaited
them, after their perilous hike across burning
deserts, towering mountain ridges, and the valley
with the evil name.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />THE HOMING PIGEON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“What are we turning aside for, Ned?” and
as Jimmy asked this question he laid a hand on
the arm of the scout master, having pushed up
from behind, leading the pack animal that had
been given over to his charge after his own was
lost.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why,” replied Ned, readily enough, “you
see, Amos lives over among those trees, where
there’s a little stream, and he hinted pretty
broadly that, while we were passing, he’d like
us to meet up with his mother.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! that’s all right,” Jimmy asserted. “I’ve
taken quite a liking for the kid and a little rest
will do the bunch good, anyway. One thing I’ve
made up my mind about, Ned, and I don’t care
who hears me say it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right, pitch in, and let’s get the glad
news, Jimmy,” remarked Jack, from a point
near by.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Never again for me to start our on a trip
afoot while I’m here in this hot country!” Jimmy
declared solemnly, holding up his hand, as
though he were in the witness box. “What
sillies we were not to have thought of that
instead of putting our good cash into that
bunco automobile that played out before it even
got decently started.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It seems that we’ve all learned our little
lesson,” Ned admitted, “and after this we ride,
if we go at all. Cars may do very well, where
there are half-way decent roads; but out on the
sandy desert and on the plains give me a broncho
every time.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But say, are you fellows noticing how jolly
this scenery is around here?” Harry wanted to
know just then, from the rear. “Look at that
sage brush on the slope of that low hill over to
the right. It must be breast high to a horse, and
seems like I could smell its fragrance away off
here. How gray it looks, except where the wind
waves it and then it seems nearly purple.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” added Ned, “and this must be what
they call rattlesnake weed, though I don’t know
what it’s got to do with the crawlers. You can
see the grasshoppers jumping in that lush stuff
where the ground’s moist. And there’s a king
bird sitting on that high weed yonder.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Listen to the gophers whistling a warning to
their kind, when they see us coming,” remarked
Jack. “Yes, Harry, you’re right, this is worth
looking at. Why, I wouldn’t be surprised now,
if at night-time, you could hear the drowsy chirp
of the crickets and the shrill rattle of katydids
around here. A bigger contrast to what we went
through in that desert you couldn’t imagine.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s sure all to the good,” asserted Jimmy,
“and I don’t blame that mother of Amos for
pitching her dugout in this particular region.
But mebbe she’ll be sorry the boy didn’t fetch
any game home with him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! Amos says he means to start out again
in a different direction and knows where he’s
pretty sure to get an antelope, anyhow,” Jack
remarked.</p>

<p class='c008' >They were now approaching the trees in which
some sort of human habitation evidently had
been constructed, for smoke was seen curling
lazily upward.</p>

<p class='c008' >It proved to be one of those half-dugout, half-building
which is to be found in many parts of
the Wild West where lumber is scarce. As there
was practically no winter weather in this part of
the country, it answered all purposes, though far
from a thing of beauty.</p>

<p class='c008' >Still, that mother of Amos’ had brightened
things up more or less, so that it could be seen
the hand of a woman was around. A small garden
lay back of the house, surrounded by a wire
fence to keep animals from devouring the precious
green stuff which was grown there.</p>

<p class='c008' >Several dogs started toward them with yelps
and deep-throated barking; and Jimmy unconsciously
reached out a hand for the Marlin that
was fastened to the pack of his burro. Jimmy’s
dislike for wolves was shared by dogs of all kinds.
He said it must have been born in him, since he
could not remember ever having had any desperate
adventure with canine foes while a kid.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos, however, threw oil on the troubled
waters and, at the sound of his voice, the fury
of the dogs changed instantly to a noisy greeting.
They jumped up and fawned on the kid in a way
that told how much they loved him. And,
doubtless, instinct told each beast that those in
company of the young master must also be
friends; for, when Ned whistled and snapped
his fingers, one of the dogs immediately started to
approach, wagging his tail in a neighborly way.</p>

<p class='c008' >A small-sized woman had come out of the
dugout and stood there with a hand shading her
eyes, as though to see who might be approaching.
Ned noticed that she carried a shotgun in her
other hand, and it struck him that a woman who
might often be left at home alone in this strange
country had need of knowing how to use some
sort of firearm.</p>

<p class='c008' >She looked very meek and did not seem to
have very much snap and go about her. When
Amos introduced the boys and told what a great
favor they had done him, she went around shaking
hands in an odd way; but evidently Mrs.
Adams differed from the vast majority of her
sex, for she did not seem to have much to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee! what a shame!” Jimmy muttered in
Ned’s ear.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What is?” asked the scout master, also in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s always the way it goes,” continued
the observing Jimmy, “seems like there never
was a shrinking little woman, as timid as they
make ’em, but what she had to go and link herself
with some big bully of a blustering man.
Opposites seem to attract in this world; you’ve
seen a speck of a girl pick out the tallest feller
she could find, and the other way, too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, it does look like that, Jimmy,” admitted
Ned, as he tried to discover some trace of spunk
about the little woman, and utterly failed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Chances are,” Jimmy continued, in his reflective
way, “that when this bad man of a Hy
Adams, the worst case along the whole border,
they say, gets on one of his tearin’ fits, he just
makes Rome howl. And say, I can just see that
poor timid little thing cowering down like a
scared puppy when it hears its master raging.
But, then, mebbe Amos he hangs around to
sort of protect his maw; though it don’t seem
as if a small chap like him could do much along
that line.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If he does, he didn’t think it right to do any
boasting that I can remember,” Ned replied,
again studying the mistress of the dugout, but
without much success.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. Adams insisted on their resting a short
while and taking a cup of coffee with her. Apparently,
she had some means of her own, for
there seemed to be plenty to do with in the place;
and when the boys saw the bunks used for sleeping
they pronounced them not at all bad. Indeed
Jimmy promptly began yawning; and, if any
one had invited him to test one of the bunks, the
chances are he would have only too willingly
complied.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was little said during the meal, at least
by the mother of Amos. Perhaps, as Jimmy
suggested in an aside to Ned, the weight of her
troubles in being mated to a human hurricane
like Hy Adams had taken all the life out of her,
and hence she evinced but little interest in whatever
happened.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos, as if to cover up this lack of conversational
gifts on the part of his mother, kept the
boys busy telling some of their past adventures.
And, finally, Ned advised that they had better
be getting ready to pull out, as considerable
territory remained to be covered before they
could expect to reach the cattle ranch buildings.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’ll sure look us up before long, Amos?”
he said to the lad, as they shook hands at parting.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I should say yes,” added impulsive Jimmy;
“because I’d hate to think I wasn’t goin’ to see
you again.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Amos looked serious.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I did promise you, didn’t I?” he observed
slowly, “and when I says a thing I nigh always
keep my word; but I kinder reckon as how I
mightn’t be welcome over to the Double Cross
Ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean, because you have the hard luck
to be connected with a bad man like Hy Adams?”
Harry remarked. “But don’t bother about a
little thing like that. My two uncles are the
kind of men who judge a fellow by what he’s
done himself, and not by his relations. Why,
we had a bad egg in our family once, and seems
to me he was hung or something of the kind.
But that’s no reason I ought to be, is it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Er, I don’t know about that,” muttered
Jimmy, with a sparkle in his fun-loving blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >The good-byes were said, and the scouts started
again toward the southeast. Amos had given
them full directions, so that there was no possibility
of their going wrong. And as the day was
far cooler than many they had experienced of
late, all of them were feeling in fine spirits.</p>

<p class='c008' >They watched the buzzards lazily wheeling
around high up in the heavens, apparently bent on
finding out where they could get their next meal.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What a fine view they must have of the plain
up there,” Harry happened to remark; “makes
me think of when we went up with those aviators,
who had the dirigible balloon near the border of
Death Valley and were experimenting in
dropping bombs down, just like will be done in the
next big war between the Nations, when battleships
must give way to aeroplanes and submarines.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Watch that hawk, will you!” cried Jack,
“see how he is chasing after that bird! I declare,
it looks like he’d sure get his dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How I hate hawks!” exclaimed Jimmy, hotly,
as he reached for his gun, “they’re the pirates
of the air, and just duck down on poor little
birds whenever they feel like having a bite. Hey!
he got the innocent that rush, didn’t he? Oh!
wouldn’t I just like to get a shot at the murderer,
though!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy, of course, forgot this was the daily
business of the hawk and that he only slew when
he was hungry and not for pleasure. He also
forgot that many men who call themselves <i>sportsmen</i>
persist in killing game or game fish long after
they have reached the limit of disposing of the
same for food and even throw the victims of their
cruelty aside in heaps—the more shame to their
claim to manhood.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, perhaps you may have a chance to play
the noble role of avenger,” chuckled Jack, “that
is, if you can shoot straight; because you notice
the hawk has now flown with his prey to that
dead treetop and alighted there. Jimmy, get
your gun and show us what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what I will,” replied the other promptly.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a pretty long shot for Jimmy. He
seemed to doubt his ability to do the needful,
without having some sort of rest for his gun.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jack, will you do me a favor?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure I will, Jimmy; just name it,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Be my gun rest, won’t you now; because I’d
like to do for that pirate the worst kind, but ’tis
thinkin’ I am that it’s a bit too far for me. What
I’ve gone through lately has made me hand a
little unsteady, like.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack was accommodating enough to back up
in front of the intended sharpshooter and arrange
himself in such fashion that Jimmy could rest
his rifle on one of his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There you are,” he remarked, placing fingers
in both ears, so that the report might not deafen
him. “I’ll hold as steady as Gibraltar Rock,
Jimmy, so if you miss you mustn’t go and lay
the blame on me, hear?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Easy now, and I’m off!” muttered the other,
as he took aim.</p>

<p class='c008' >The sharp report sounded a couple of seconds
later.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bully for you, Jimmy!” shouted Jack, immediately.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did I get him?” cried the delighted marksman.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you!” echoed Harry, “look at him circling
down to the ground right now! You
knocked him galley-west, I should say, if I was
on a boat now. Go and get your game, Jimmy,
and let’s see the old buccaneer.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bring in the dinner he caught, too,” remarked
Ned, “I’m curious to see what it is; because
it didn’t look like any wild bird around
here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And be careful how you handle the hawk, if
he’s only winged,” warned Jack, “for they can
fight like all get-out, and the first thing he’ll try
to get at will be your eyes. Knock him on the
head, Jimmy, before you handle him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shucks! tell me somethin’ I don’t know!”
laughed the other, starting off, gun in hand,
toward the trees growing along the same stream
that passed the door of Hy Adams’ dugout, some
three miles away.</p>

<p class='c008' >He came back after a little while carrying a
dead hawk.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It was a fine shot, for a fact!” admitted Jack,
as he took the bird into his hands, the better to
see where the bullet had struck.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s that you’ve got besides, Jimmy?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me to the foolish house if it don’t make me
think of a pet pigeon I used to have long ago,”
Jimmy ventured.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It <i>is</i> a pigeon,” said Ned, as he handled the
dead bird that had been chased and captured by
the hungry hawk.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s that, Ned; a tame pigeon out here
on the plains?” Jack questioned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, there are no wild pigeons any more, all
gone,” Ned explained, “and this bird is a passenger
pigeon or a carrier. You can see from the
odd shape of its bill.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What they call a homing pigeon, you mean,
don’t you, Ned?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just that,” was the reply, “and here, as sure
as you live, there’s a message tied with a thread
to his leg, right now. Why, somebody must have
been experimenting sending a message back
home by this air post.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Blast that old hawk, he spoiled the whole
game!” muttered Jimmy, wrathfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But stop and think, Jimmy,” Harry told
him, “if it hadn’t been for the hawk you shot, we
wouldn’t have known about this thing at all.
But there’s Ned opening the little piece of tissue
paper on which the message is written. Tell us
about it, Ned, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The scout master was staring at the thin piece
of paper he had smoothed out, as though it contained
certain information that interested him
deeply.</p>

<p class='c008' >And as the other three scouts gathered around
him, eagerly waiting until he took them more
fully into his confidence, they seemed to feel as
though the very air was charged with a fresh
supply of mystery.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />AT DOUBLE CROSS RANCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The first words spoken by Ned added to the
puzzle, for he turned to his chums and propounded
a question.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did any of you happen to notice which way
the pigeon was flying, before the hawk darted
out from the trees and chased it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” Jack informed him promptly, “I saw
the bird coming away in the distance, and it was
flying as straight as an arrow, when the hawk
shot up out of the screen of the trees and made
it swerve to try and escape; but it wasn’t quick
enough.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Which way was it coming then?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack pointed toward the southeast.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Right yonder and in the same direction we’re
heading,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned frowned and looked even more serious.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then it begins to look as though this messenger
pigeon might have been freed from somewhere
about your uncle’s ranch, Harry, and was
making for its coop when the hawk killed it.
You know they’ve been known to fly hundreds
and hundreds of miles, even from New York to
Pittsburgh, and arrive safe, tired, and half-starved
after a couple of days.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It always did beat my time how they did it,”
said Jack, “though what you say is true, every
word of it, Ned. But what is there so stunning
about the fact of this bird having been set loose
at the ranch? Some puncher may be a homing
pigeon fancier and sends a bird to his home,
many miles away, once in so often. It would be
a great little stunt, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, ditto here,” added Harry, “so tell us
why you think it’s queer, Ned.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“On account of the message,” replied the scout
master.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, we don’t know what that is, so read it
out!” urged Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right, I will,” Ned told them, and then
glancing down once more at the thin piece of
paper he held he continued: “‘Some talk of
both bosses going to W. soon. Be ready to act.
Will let you know in time! Chances good for big
sweep! We count five!’”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Glory hallelujah! what’s all that patter
mean?” gasped Jimmy, who seemed unable to
make head or tail out of the communication.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack and Harry, however, realized that Ned
was about right when he said it looked as though
there might be more in the message than appeared
on the bare face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You notice that it says <i>two</i> bosses, don’t
you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, and that must refer to my two uncles,
Colonel Job Haines and James Henshaw?”
Harry suggested.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What does the W mean?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think that must be a town on the railroad,
where they ship the cattle in season,” replied Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘Be ready to act,’ it goes on to say,” Jack
continued, “which would make it appear as
though the writer knew there was some sort of
a raid contemplated.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“A raid!” echoed Jimmy, “faith, d’ye mean
by rustlers?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the only kind of raid cattlemen fear
nowadays, since the wild animals have been well
cleaned out and the reds stick to their reservations
pretty much all the time,” Harry informed
him, “but just to think of what this would stand
for, if it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“A traitor or traitors employed at the Double
Cross Ranch,” the scout master declared. “Well
that wouldn’t be the first time such a thing had
happened. In fact, these cattle rustlers usually
have means for learning all that is going on with
the punchers. In that way, they manage to
time their raids when most of the hands are away.
Seems that there might be quite a bunch of the
hounds, because he mentions the fact that the
party he’s sending the message to can count on
five to muss things up at the time the raid is
engineered.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry laughed grimly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Perhaps, now, my Uncle Job won’t be
tickled half to death to get hold of this telltale
message!” he gurgled. “If only he can find who
wrote the same, it’ll turn out to be his Waterloo,
believe me, if half I’ve heard about Uncle Job
is true.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And that ought to be easy,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean, he could tell from the handwriting?”
Harry demanded.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, but there would be a better way than
that,” the other scout continued, as he gave Ned
a knowing nod.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Tis the pigeon, you must mean!” exclaimed
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s it,” Jack acknowledged, “and surely
a fellow couldn’t keep birds like that and set one
flying every once in so often, without others
knowing about it. Find the puncher who’s got
the homing pigeon fancy and you’ll have the
leader of the spies at the Double Cross, if that’s
where the bird started from.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The scout master nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That was well figured out, Jack,” he said,
“and did your scout logic credit. A scout has
got to keep his wits sharpened and not let anything
slip past him, no matter how small it may
seem. Of course, the owner of the pigeon must
be guilty; and, just as you say, it wouldn’t be
easy for him to carry on with his birds unless
most of the other punchers knew about it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But the message?” Jimmy objected.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! they didn’t see this one, but another
that the fellow would be smart enough to get up,
and <i>pretend</i> to fasten to the leg of the air traveler,”
Jack went on to say, in a way that showed
how his mind had grasped the subject.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned carefully folded the tissue paper and put
it safely away in his pocketbook.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That was the luckiest shot you ever made, I
take it, Jimmy,” he remarked, turning to the
freckled-faced chum, who immediately puffed
his chest out in a ridiculous fashion and began
to pretend to take on airs.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! the rest of you can do some stunts once
in a coon’s age,” he told them, “but when it
comes right down to taking the cake, you have
to apply to your Uncle Jimmy. I managed to
land there with both feet. Luck and me, we’re
bedfellers, you see. But then, far from me
’twould be to boast. It was a fair shot, Ned, I
admit it. And the McGraw luck held good.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’ll have to let me in on a little of that,
Jimmy,” Jack told him, “because you happened
to be using my shoulder at the time, remember.
Only for that, chances are you’d have lost the
hawk and we’d never have known that it was a
homer he had caught for his lunch.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shake on that, Jack; you’re in,” Jimmy was
quick to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But we’d better be going on, hadn’t we?”
Harry asked. “Because I’m more anxious now
than ever to pull up at the ranch house.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” Ned informed them, “we’ve got a long
walk ahead of us yet. I’ll do up the pigeon and
the hawk to show your uncle, on the quiet, when
there’s no one else around. You see, he’s apt to
think we may be yarning, because it’s a queer
and fishy story, come to think of it; and the more
proof we have the better.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Takes you to look away ahead,” declared
Jack; “now, like as not, I’d have tossed both
birds away and then wished I hadn’t later on.
An ounce of prevention is better than a pound
of cure, they say. The fellow who can think
ahead takes the cake.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then I’m goin’ to get busy and be that feller,”
Jimmy assured them, “because I always
did like cake.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The forward march was resumed, with the
three burros plodding along after their accustomed
slow method of travel. They had to be
urged frequently, with the tickle of a whip.
The only times they showed traces of eagerness
were when approaching places where water could
be had, and then they almost ran.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the afternoon wore along, the scouts knew
that they were drawing near a cattle ranch.
Many things told them this pleasing news. They
found tracks of droves all about them on the
grassy plain, and three times had they glimpsed
a feeding herd in the swale, where some low hills
joined the more level ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I can see houses among the trees ahead
there!” announced Ned, after he had had the
field glasses up to his eye for a short time.</p>

<p class='c008' >All of them wanted to take a look, then, and
great was the rejoicing when it was found to be
true.</p>

<p class='c008' >“About two miles more of this weary hiking,
and then good-bye to it!” Jack gave as his opinion,
in which the other joined.</p>

<p class='c008' >They took a fresh start after that, and it was
not long before Jimmy declared he could see a
bunch of riders starting out from the trees and
heading toward them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“They’ve sighted us,” asserted Ned, “and, of
course, wonder who we can be; because Harry
here thought to take his uncles by surprise and
didn’t tell them when to expect us, except to
say, we’d probably drop in on the ranch if down
this way.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You see,” Harry went on to explain, “when
I wrote last, it was from Los Angeles; and, about
that time, I didn’t feel so sure we’d ever get
through alive.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“First time I knew you felt worried,” Ned
told him. “All of you seemed so dead set on
carrying out the programme that I couldn’t say
what I thought.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You must mean,” Jack said, “that it looked
silly and foolish to think we could cross the
deserts and mountain canyons in that old rantankerous
automobile?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned laughed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Never mind what I thought,” he remarked.
“It’s too late now to cry over spilt milk. We
got through, didn’t we? And we’ve had experiences
that will always stay with us. That’s
enough. And, at last, we can see our goal just
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hurrah for the Double Cross Ranch!” exclaimed
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >The half-dozen cowboys came whirling toward
them, shouting, swinging their hats, and riding
as only punchers on the plains can.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Remember, everybody,” warned Ned, “not
a word about that hawk and pigeon episode.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We understand what you mean, Ned,”
Harry replied.</p>

<p class='c008' >Presently the mad riders came galloping up in
a cloud of alkali dust.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Told you so, boys!” cried a tall rangy fellow,
who sat his pony as though he might be a part
of the animal—one of those Centaurs of old.
“Ketch on to the scout togs, would you? Say,
are you Harry Stevens?”</p>

<p class='c008' >He had unconsciously picked out Ned when
asking this question, because he must have somehow
seen that he was the leader; perhaps, it
was partly from his looks; and, then again, the
fact that Ned had no burro to take care of, while
all his companions did, may have had something
to do with it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, but I’m his chum, Ned Nestor. That’s
Harry over yonder, and I reckon now that we’re
glad to be at the Double Cross.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But where’d you come from, pard?” demanded
the cowboy, who had thrown one leg
over his saddle, the better to talk.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Los Angeles,” replied Ned, indifferently.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that the punchers stared and even exchanged
various winks and nods.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not with them lazy burros, I opine, pard?”
ventured the spokesman.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! no, we picked these up in the hills, buying
them from prospectors, who had had enough and
were meaning to go home,” Ned informed him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That was after our automobile broke down
and had to be abandoned, in the middle of the
Mojave Desert,” Harry volunteered.</p>

<p class='c008' >The cow-puncher gave a whistle to indicate his
surprise. Ned noticed that his manner had
changed somewhat, too. Doubtless, because
these boys were from the East and somewhat
green with regard to ranch ways, he may have
imagined, in the beginning, that they were genuine
tenderfeet.</p>

<p class='c008' >He knew better now. Any party of boys who
could by themselves cross that terrible Mojave
Desert and make their way down to this country
bordering the Colorado River, must surely be
made of the right stuff.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get up behind me, Ned, and ride the rest of
the way; proud to have you join us. And we
reckons as how we’ll give you the time of your
life while you’re at the old Double Cross Ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned promptly accepted this invitation on the
part of the lanky puncher, whom he heard called
“Chunky,” probably because he was just the
opposite; while a real fat roly-poly sort of a
rider answered, when they addressed him as
“Skinny,” which made it look as though these
boys might have drawn the wrong slips out of
the hat at the ranch christening.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jack, Harry and Jimmy were all similarly
accommodated with seats, while two other
punchers promised to see that the pack animals
got in.</p>

<p class='c008' >A wild ride they made of those two miles.
The scouts clasped their arms around their new
friends and held on for dear life; but none of
them fell off and presently they found themselves
in front of the ranch house.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sorry to tell ye, Harry,” announced the
lanky puncher, “that both your uncles, together
with a couple of the boys, has headed for the
railroad, to fetch home a bunch of imported
stock they sent for, meaning to improve the
breed of our long horns. So ye’ll have to wait
two days or so before you see ’em; but Aunt
Mehitabel, she’s inside, and will make you all
welcome, sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c008' >With that the four punchers were off again,
doubtless to attend to some of the duties they
were hired to perform.</p>

<p class='c008' >The four boys stood there exchanging significant
looks, as the sun drew near the distant
western horizon.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Looks some serious, don’t it?” remarked
Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Both bosses have gone away just as that
message said,” Jack observed. “I wonder, now,
if these conspirators will try to send another
communication to their rustler friends.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m afraid that has already been done,” Ned
told them, “and we were powerless to stop it.
Because just as we rode up, I saw a pigeon flying
in by circles high up in the air; then, as if it had
gotten its bearings, it went off on a straight line
into the northwest. That bird must have carried
the news that the time to strike had come.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The scouts were now confronted by conditions
calculated to keep them guessing at a lively rate.
With both owners of the ranch away, to whom
were they to communicate their alarming news?
How could they know that in this telling the
story, they might not be giving themselves away
to one of the suspects?</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a situation calling for considerable head
work and reasoning, so that a serious mistake
might not be made in the start.</p>

<p class='c008' >What made it still more difficult to manage
was the fact, which Harry seemed to be aware of,
that there was no real foreman on the place;
Colonel Job himself filling that position, while
James Henshaw took other duties upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How about telling your Aunt Mehitabel
about it, Harry?” Ned asked, as they exchanged
views and seemed to get no nearer a definite
arrangement.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what we’ll have to do,” replied the other
chum, “and say, if only she’ll agree to let us have
a free hand, and tell the boys to do what we
want, p’raps we might find some way yet to
upset the game of the rustlers.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You just bet we will that!” said Jimmy, with
all the confidence of one whose lexicon knew no
such word as fail.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The first thing we must do,” ventured Ned,
seriously, “is to find out who it is sends these
treacherous messages to parties that have evil
designs on the herds of the Double Cross Ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Them, you mean, don’t you, Ned,” added
Jack, “because that message spoke of there being
five all told who would look out and see that
things were made easy picking.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” spoke up Jimmy, with a cunning leer,
“sometimes you think I’m sleepy, but I notice
that now and then I manage to wake up long
enough to do my little stunt. His handle, it’s
Ally Sloper, by the same token.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Who’s that?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The dub that owns the homing pigeons,”
came the ready reply, which caused Ned to smile
and nod his head in approbation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good work, Jimmy!” he remarked, “you
must have asked the fellow you rode in behind?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what I did, Ned,” Jimmy told him. “I
mentioned the fact that we had seen a pigeon
flying, and then he says as how this same Ally
Sloper he had got about five birds from a feller
over in Kingman, on the railroad beyond the
Opal and the Blue Ridge Mountains down in
Arizona. He was told to let one go every little
while, to see if they’d get safe home again. But,
fellers, that place lies to the southeast as you
know, and we saw that pigeon away off to the
<i>northwest</i> of here, which says Ally Sloper he just
lies!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s a fine start,” commended the scout
master. “We know who the chief spy is, and it
ought to be an easy thing to learn who his close
pals seem to be, for like as not he’d stick only to
those who are in the same boat with him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sounds well to me, Ned,” Jack remarked,
after apparently turning the matter over carefully
in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the game?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here’s the way it stands,” remarked Ned,
soberly. “That second message must have been
sent to tell the gang that both bosses are away,
and conditions looking good for a raid to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whew! so soon as that?” ejaculated Jack,
drawing a long sigh, for he was pretty tired and
had calculated on getting rested up between
sunset and another dawn; if, as they suspected,
there were going to be great goings-on around
the cattle ranch before many hours, it was possible
that they might be on the jump all night;
but then, Jack was a fellow who could stand considerable
punishment without throwing up the
sponge, and that intake of breath might simply
mean a resolution to do his part in the drama.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If there was only some way now to round the
cattle up and drive them into the stockades or
corrals, so they could be guarded,” Ned continued,
as though he might have been doing more
or less planning before the critical moment arrived,
“why, we might hold the fort until morning
and not lose any of the herds.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you suppose it could be done?” Harry
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I see no reason why not,” came the sturdy
reply. “It looked to me like the herds were
grazing within a few miles of here, though there
may be some further off. Now, if the punchers
only got the fever on them, I’ve no doubt they
could round the steers and cows up and get them
in the stockade long before the rustlers would
think of coming along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“There’s one bully thing about it,” ventured
Harry, smilingly. “We’re going to have a full
moon to-night, and a cattle drive will be a picnic.
If it was pitch dark, or stormy, it might be a
different story. The scout luck holds good.
Things may look a bit gloomy for a while, but
we get there in the end.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll tell you one reason why it’s important
that we should find out just who the cronies of
this Ally Sloper are,” continued Ned. “It would
be a bad thing now if we sent the whole five out
in a batch, because, believing their game was
up and that it would be unsafe for them to ever
come back here, chances are they would take
advantage of their opportunity to run off a herd
while about it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb—is
that what you mean, Ned?” Jack asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, about that way,” the scout master replied.
“On the other hand, if they are broken
up, and only one sent out with each bunch of
punchers to corral the herds, these spies will not
be able to work anything crooked. We’ll draw
their claws, as you might say, and make them
harmless.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here comes my aunt,” Harry broke in with, as
a large woman brushed out of the doorway of the
commodious ranch house and approached them.</p>

<p class='c008' >She was an amiable woman, they could see at
first glance; but Ned fancied that, in an emergency,
Aunt Mehitabel would not prove capable
of gripping the reins. No doubt, during all her
married life she had depended on her able husband
to manage things on the outside, being
content on her part to see that things moved
along regularly within doors, and that meals
came on time.</p>

<p class='c008' >She greeted Harry warmly and was also delighted
to meet his chums, all of whom she urged
to go inside the house with her.</p>

<p class='c008' >But the occasion was so serious that Ned did
not wish to waste any more time than was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ve come to make you quite a little visit,
ma’m,” Ned remarked, after she had urged them
to make themselves at home, and do whatever
they pleased, “and later on we expect to have a
great time riding around the country and seeing
things. But it is unfortunate that neither one
of Harry’s uncles is home right now, because
we’ve got some very important news.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The lady of the house looked worried at once,
just as Ned had anticipated would be the case.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! what can it be?” she asked, her voice
showing traces of nervousness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“On the way our chum, Jimmy here, happened
to shoot a hawk that had pounced down on a
flying pigeon. Wrapped around one of the pigeon’s
legs was a piece of tissue paper, and bearing
a message. I have it here with me, and both
the hawk and the pigeon are in one of our packs
on the burros. This message was not signed, but
it plainly announced that there are five untrustworthy
men employed on this place who are in
league with cattle rustlers.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mercy on us, you don’t say! And the colonel
away, too! Whatever will become of us now?”
Mrs. Haines started to wail, when Ned smilingly
went on to soothe her by remarking:</p>

<p class='c008' >“But here are four stout boys, ready to do
their level best to upset the plans of these cattle
thieves, if given half a chance, ma’m. Now, in
this message, it is promised that if the conditions
look favorable, another line will be sent, the same
way as this was. And as we came up we saw a
pigeon flying into the west, so we take it for
granted that has been done, and the rustler
crowd will get busy between now and sun-up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“The herds are all out on the range, unfortunately,
and it is too late now to get them in,”
the lady went on to say, dejectedly. “Oh! how
unfortunate that you did not arrive a few hours
ago, when my husband would have been here to
take charge of things, for we have no foreman,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It may not be too late, even now, to get the
herds rounded up and brought in to the corral
where the boys can guard them,” Ned told her.</p>

<p class='c008' >She looked at him admiringly, doubtless impressed,
as many others had been before then,
with his manly bearing and the resolute look on
his face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I really believe that if any one could manage
it, you could, my son!” she said, with a simplicity
and ardor that caused the warm glow to spread
over Ned’s face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“With what assistance you might give us,
Mrs. Haines, we believe we can save the cattle
from this threatened raid,” he continued, calmly.
“And first of all it is of the utmost importance
that we learn just who these other four punchers
may be who are hand in glove with Ally Sloper—the
man who has sent the pigeon messenger.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! so he is the one?” she cried, “and I never
could bear the sight of his face, because of the
cast in that evil eye of his. But Job always
laughed at me, and said Ally Sloper was one of
the best men he had on the place. What do you
want me to do, for you said I could help you win
out?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“First of all, in the absence of your husband
and Harry’s other uncle,” began the scout master,
just for all the world, Jimmy thought, like
a great general, such as Napoleon or Grant, laying
out his campaign, “it seems as if the men
would take orders from you. Am I right there?</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, it has happened a few times, but I would
not have known a thing about what to do, only
for Chunky’s advice,” she told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! you can rely on Chunky then, can you?”
asked Ned, quickly, for that was one of the points
he wanted settled, because a great deal depended
on it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Always. My husband would trust him with
his life. If ever we do have a foreman at the
Double Cross, Chunky will be the one.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m glad to hear that, because I rode in behind
him, and somehow I fancied he would be
the one to confide in. Please send out for him
as soon as you can, ma’m, because we have little
time to waste. I hope to learn from Chunky
just who the other four traitors are, for he will
have noticed how this Ally Sloper picks out his
friends. Birds of a feather flock together, you
know; and these fellows would feel safer if they
kept in constant touch with each other.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The other scouts approved of what Ned was
doing, as their manner of nodding at different
times indicated. They knew that their leader
was equal to running things, even though he
might not know so much about the working of a
cattle ranch. And in times gone by they had
seen him pitted against what seemed to be overwhelming
odds, to win out in the end; so that
they had unbounded confidence in whatever he
started to do.</p>

<p class='c008' >The rancher’s wife left them for a minute, and
presently came back to say that she had sent
out the Chink cook, Chin-chin Charlie, to find
Chunky, and tell him to come right to the house
on important business.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll get this working pretty soon, I think,”
Jack declared, with animation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And they’ll just have to hunt up some broncs
for the lot of us to straddle, too,” added
Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell me about that,” chuckled Jimmy. “How
glad I’ll be to mount a fiery charger and dig me
heels into his flanks, after all this terrible walkin’
the lot of us have been doin’ lately. I do be
wishin’ Chunky’d hurry. If he’s gone off now,
and couldn’t be found at the bunkhouse, we’ll
be in a nice pickle, sure.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t worry, because I think he’s coming,”
Ned told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Just as he said, this lanky puncher came up
on the verandah of the ranch. He was quickly
put in possession of the facts, and expressed
himself in forcible terms concerning the alleged
treachery of Ally Sloper and his four allies.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I c’n put a hand on the hull blooming lot,”
he declared, “because it happens as how that
same Ally has been keepin’ company with jest
four punchers. They are Lefty Louie, Coyote
Smith, Bob Caruso that the boys calls Robinson
Crusoe, and Tinplate George—all clever punchers,
but mighty slick articles at that. If Miss
Haines sez as how we take our orders from you,
Ned, just give the word, and you’ll see them
warts arounded up like grease.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! well, we ought to go to extremes only as
a last resort, I think,” said Mrs Haines, who
dreaded lest there be some shooting in making
the arrest, and that some of the boys who were
her favorites would get hurt. “Ned has a plan
that might answer the same purpose. Tell him
about it, Ned, please.”</p>

<p class='c008' >So the scout master unfolded his scheme.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How many herds are there on the range just
now, Chunky?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Four, all told, with a smattering of others
that don’t ’mount to much.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Suppose, then, you make me out a list of the
punchers, so that there will be one of these suspects
with every bunch, not counting Ally
Sloper,” Ned continued.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hello! I’m beginnin’ to tumble to the game
and, let me say, it fills the bill first-class,” was
the quick comment of the lanky one.</p>

<p class='c008' >He gave the names to Ned as rapidly as the
other could write them down; and it was speedily
arranged, so that of the four parties one of
the conspirators had been designated to accompany
each. As for Ally himself, it did not matter
much what he did, though they must keep him
under surveillance, lest he upset all their cleverly
laid plans by cutting the corral or, in some other
fashion, rendering it impossible to keep all the
hundreds of longhorns near the ranch house,
where they could be guarded.</p>

<p class='c008' >All this was fixed up in a very short space of
time and then Ned declared they ought to get
busy. The sun was sinking toward the western
horizon; but they knew there was going to be
no period of darkness, because the moon was full,
which meant that it would rise exactly at sunset.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We can eat after we’ve got those herds
rounded up and safe in the corral, not before,”
was Ned’s ultimatum, when Mrs. Haines spoke
about supper; and this caused one long face to
make itself seen among the scouts, for Jimmy
dearly loved his feed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />NIPPING A MUTINY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Once Chunky knew what was expected of him,
and he proved that he could do things with a
hurricane rush. Most cow-punchers are of his
stripe, and speed is a mania on the range.</p>

<p class='c008' >“First thing I’ll run out some ponies for you
young fellers to mount,” he told the scouts, as
he turned to leave the verandah where the short
talk had taken place.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me for a piebald mustang!” called out Jimmy,
“I’ve somehow had that in my mind ever since
I set eyes on that speckled pony belongin’ to
Amos. Fix me up that way, if you want to see
me happy, Mister Chunky.”</p>

<p class='c008' >And greatly to Jimmy’s delight, he was later
on given just such a mount as he called for;
though as for Ned, he did not wholly fancy the
peculiar whitish eyes that were a feature of the
fancy looking beast. He imagined that the
animal had an ugly temper, if crossed, and hoped
that Jimmy might not rue the day he yearned
for a mottled cow pony.</p>

<p class='c008' >Meanwhile the big bell had been clanged that
would serve as a signal to tell all on the place
that their presence was immediately desired.
They came trooping out of the bunk house and
from the direction of the corral, where it chanced
they had been busily engaged at the time.</p>

<p class='c008' >Curiosity could be seen stamped on most of
their bronzed faces. Ned looked for the man
called Ally Sloper, and who had been described
to him so cleverly that he fancied he could pick
him out among the throng.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even if he had not been advised beforehand,
he knew he could have settled upon the man;
because, while nearly all the others seemed jolly
and carefree, his face bore a dark frown.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned believed the man suspected something;
that he feared this hasty and unusual summons
might interfere with the cunning scheme engineered
for that night. And while not appearing
to watch the puncher at all, Ned could easily see
that he made frequent signals, when he thought
himself unobserved, to several others, whom Ned
also marked down as the secret allies of the
rustler’s spy.</p>

<p class='c008' >These things, while seemingly unimportant,
were really of considerable consequence, because
much depended on their keeping the traitors
from communicating with their friends in the
hills.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is that Sloper with the hat on the back of
his head?” he asked Chunky, in a low tone, as
the men were coming up.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, and the one with him is Lefty Louie;
that sneak trailin’ along at his heels is Coyote
Smith. Bob Caruso is the feller larfin’ right now,
and which makes him look like he could swallow
a heifer easy; and Tinplate George is at the end
of the bunch, limpin’ some, ’count of a fling he
got yesterday with a buckin’ broncho. Got ’em
all sized up now, have ye, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, and tell Mrs. Haines to start the circus
right away, Chunky,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c008' >The rancher’s wife had been nervously waiting
for a sign. She now stepped forward and held
up her hand, so that all noise ceased, and the
men listened eagerly, for their curiosity had been
greatly excited.</p>

<p class='c008' >“During the absence of Colonel Haines and
Mr. Henshaw, you are to take your orders from
this young man here, Ned Nestor, and through
Chunky, who will act as temporary foreman.
An emergency has arisen, making it very necessary
that all our herds be rounded up immediately
and driven into the big corral, where they
can be guarded to-night. Ask no questions, but
do your duty as employees of this ranch. That
is all I wish to say, and I feel sure that every one
of you will understand that I am in consultation
with those I have put in charge and that it is my
wishes they are carrying out.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The punchers stared at each other. They
could, of course, give a pretty good guess what
this must mean, for the only real danger that
could be feared at this time of year would be
from rustlers.</p>

<p class='c008' >As a rule, they were a jolly lot of carefree
fellows, willing to work double one day and loaf
the next, as the occasion arose; it was all in the
line of business with them.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had been watching Ally Sloper out of the
tail of his eye. He saw the man scowl like a
pirate of the Spanish Main. Of course, this was
going to interfere seriously with all the well-laid
plans between the spies and their rustler allies.
They may have waited a long time for this very
chance, when both proprietors of the ranch
would be away at the same time; and, now that
it had come, to be balked in their designs was
enough to throw such a tempestuous man into
a fury.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s going to make trouble right away,
Ned,” whispered Jack in the ear of the scout
master.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let him try it, and see what he runs up
against, that’s all,” Ned replied, as he watched
Ally Sloper pushing his way to the front.</p>

<p class='c008' >Somehow the other four did not follow him.
They were wise enough to realize that such a
move might expose them to suspicion. If Sloper
chose to protest against being sent out on the
range at this late hour of the day, that was his
privilege; but there was no necessity for them
to show their hand so early in the game. They
knew what the anger of cow-punchers was like
and had a healthy respect for it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Before the advancing man could get near
enough to say anything, Chunky began to speak
as though he did not notice this aggressive movement.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll head one party, and with me will go
Arizona Tom, Dutchy, Ally Sloper and two of the
visitors at the ranch. Skinny will take another
party to bring in the herd from the alfalfa
prairie,” and so he went on apportioning the
men, placing one he could positively trust at the
head of each detachment, and making sure that
each squad held a “suspect.”</p>

<p class='c008' >It had all been well laid out, and in the strongest
bunch, consisting of seven riders, two of the
unfaithful lot had been included. Each party
had been given a particular herd to manage, so
that the work could be carried out in systematic
order.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, Chunky intended to give the several
leaders a quiet tip before they started out, so
that they could keep an eye on the suspects and
thwart any move that looked as though they
meant to slip away, or send warning to their
friends in the hills.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sloper had stood and listened to what Chunky
said. Evidently it confirmed what suspicions he
may have already had concerning the breaking
up of their plot. And he would have been a
stupid man not to have connected the coming
of the scouts with this sudden move, looking to
a round-up that had not been ordered by the
proprietors of the big ranch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Some of the men had started to hurry away;
others stood there in a half-hesitating way, as
though they had noticed the belligerent attitude
of Ally Sloper and wished to see what he meant
to do. He may have given trouble on other
past occasions and was only kept on account of
his acknowledged skill as a puncher.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold on there, Chunky, I want to say as I
aint agoin’ out on the range with ye this time.
I reckons as how I’ve done a good hard day’s
work a’ready. ’Sides that, take it from me
straight that I don’t mean to look to a <i>kid</i> like
this here newcomer for my boss. I’m alayin’
down on the job for onct, see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, I don’t see, Sloper,” returned the emaciated
puncher, facing the other, a gleam in his
eyes that was not nice to watch. “Are you
sick?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What, me? Did ye ever know me to be sick?
No, ’taint that. I jest don’t keer to work any
more to-day. I’m agoin’ to the bunk house an’
lie down to smoke.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re goin’ out on the range with me,
Sloper, hear that?” gritted Chunky, as he faced
the other defiantly. “You heard the rancher’s
wife give her orders; and, also, the fact that she
says as how we are all to look to this young chap
as her representative; likewise that I’m to advise
him, seein’ as how he ain’t well up in range
ways. I’ve selected <i>you</i> to be in my party. I
want you for a good many reasons, one o’ which
are that you ain’t got anything on me when it
comes to roundin’ up longhorns. So make up
your mind you’re agoin’ out and help git that
prize herd in from the Washout Coulie.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t take my orders from any snip like
that, I tell you, and I ain’t agoin’ to stand for
you bein’ foreman here, Chunky, understand
that!” the mutineer rasped, while four other
punchers moved a little closer and waited to see
how their ally came through, before they tried
to copy his tactics; if he succeeded, they could
follow suit; whereas, should he make a failure,
they were at liberty to draw back and hold their
horses for a more convenient season.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! is that so, Sloper?” remarked the tall
puncher, quickly, “an’ tell me how you expect
to keep from goin’ out on the range with my
party?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I throw up my job right here, see?” almost
shouted Sloper. “You get what I says, don’t
you? You can’t order me around, when I’m a
free agent. And I ain’t workin’ for the Double
Cross people any more. I’m done.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! yes, you are,” sneered Chunky. “We’ll
just look into that, Sloper. I reckons as how
Colonel Job fixed things so he could count on
<i>your</i> services a certain time. You’re under contract
here. Mrs. Haines, kin you tell me how
much longer Sloper’s agreement to work for the
owners of the Double Cross Ranch, or whoever
they chose to app’nt foreman here, has to run?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just two months more,” replied the colonel’s
wife, who kept the books of the ranch and, therefore,
knew all about the dealings with all the
hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That settles it then, Sloper,” said Chunky.
“We need your services right bad to git them
cattle into the stockade. And let me tell you
right here, you’re agoin’ out on the range with
us now and work alongside the rest of the boys,
or somethin’ is likely to happen right suddent.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He carelessly let his hand slip around to the
butt of his gun while saying this. Jimmy and,
perhaps Harry, anticipated seeing some fireworks,
because they thought Sloper was a gunfighter;
but Ned could read character better
and he had already decided that the man had a
craven soul back of all his bluster. So he was
not at all surprised to see him quail before the
steady gaze of Chunky.</p>

<p class='c008' >“This is a raw deal you’re givin’ me, Chunky!”
he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m doin’ jest what Colonel Job’d do if he
was on the spot, and one of his contract men
tried to lay down on him,” retorted the other
positively. “After he gits back, if you care to
take it up with him, ye kin do it. But while I’m
runnin’ things, alongside o’ this younker here,
you’ll do your part, or I’ll know the reason why.
Now, boys, git your ponies and we’ll be off.
Thar’s a heap o’ hard work to do afore we kin
take things easy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He managed matters so that he could say a
few words to Skinny and the other two dependable
punchers who had been placed in charge of
the third and fourth parties.</p>

<p class='c008' >They were told to keep a watchful eye on the
suspected ones, though there was no time to
explain just why. But, after all, there could be
but one reason for giving this warning, and
Skinny, as well as the other leaders, were able
to figure it out. They had already guessed that
news had come concerning a contemplated foray
on the part of rustlers and that these men were
suspected of being hand in glove with the lawless
night runners of cattle.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was presently a bustling scene as the
punchers saddled their ponies and prepared for
hard work out on the range.</p>

<p class='c008' >Chunky managed to keep close to Ally Sloper
all of the time and the man, seeing this, did not
dare venture anything like flight, lest he be followed
by a shower of bullets.</p>

<p class='c008' >Orders were given for ponies for the four scouts
and it was not long before they found themselves
mounted on frisky bronchos, which it took all
their skill to manage. But fortunately all of
them had done considerable riding in times past,
so that they did themselves credit. And doubtless
the punchers had picked animals that, according
to their way of thinking, were exceedingly
docile, though quite lively enough to suit
Ned and his chums.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was Jimmy grinning from the back of
a beautifully spotted animal, and apparently as
happy as any one could be. He had found a way
to sling his gun, so as to have both hands free to
manage the mount; and, truth to tell, there
were times when Jimmy was apt to wish he had
a third hand in the bargain, for the calico pony
proved to be the most unruly one of the quartette.</p>

<p class='c008' >All this was done in a comparatively short
time, because each puncher looked out for himself.
Harry and Jack were to accompany
Skinny’s bunch, while Jimmy and Ned meant to
be with Chunky. This arrangement satisfied
the scout master, who felt that if there was anything
going on it was apt to be in connection with
that detachment which had Ally Sloper on its
roll call. And, as usual, Ned wanted to be on
the firing line when things were happening.</p>

<p class='c008' >Owing to various causes Chunky’s bunch was
the last to get away. In three separate directions
could be seen little clouds of alkali dust in
which the reckless riders had vanished, heading
for the feeding grounds of the herds, to which
they had been assigned.</p>

<p class='c008' >As these lay some miles away, and the task of
rounding up the cattle, as well as driving them
on the return trip, would consume considerable
time, it was not expected that the first of the
herds would reach the stockade until the moon
was several hours high.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Ned and Jimmy galloped forth, keeping
close to the other four riders, they turned in the
saddle to wave to the stockman’s wife, who
stood on the piazza, to see the last of them off,
with the Chinese cook close by, and also a couple
of women, who were also employed in the
house.</p>

<p class='c008' >The scout master believed he had reason to
feel satisfied, because he had been allowed to
balk the treacherous designs of those who would
have sacrificed the property of their employer
by sending word to the cattle rustlers. But as
his eye wandered over to where the sullen Ally
Sloper sat his saddle, Ned knew that this was
hardly the end. A man of his double nature was
not apt to throw up his hands and acknowledge
himself beaten, just because he had been knocked
down in the first round.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’ll bear close watching,” was Ned’s mental
comment, “and even then chances are he may
find a way to slip us, when the excitement of
rounding-up the steers and the cows is on. But
once we get the herd started home, I don’t believe
he’d be able to do us any great harm, if he
did skip out. Still, Chunky is dealing with the
hound and I mustn’t interfere.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />AT WASHOUT COULIE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Is it very far we have to go for our herd,
Ned?” asked Jimmy, as he galloped along briskly
at the side of his chum, managing the calico pony
pretty fairly for one who had never been used to
range riding and knew very little about the
tricks of cow ponies.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I believe further than any others of the
lot,” Ned told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I heard some mention of a Washout Coulie;
is that where we’re headin’ right now; and why
d’ye reckon they give it such a funny name?”
Jimmy continued.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’re making for a place of that name, I
understood Chunky to say,” the accommodating
scout master replied, “and he spoke as though
their best herd might be using that section for a
feeding ground just now; but why they call it
Washout Coulie, I’m unable to say.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“A coulie is always connected with some sort
of hill, isn’t it, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Strikes me that way, Jimmy, and, as you
know there <i>are</i> hills over this way, for we could
see them when we came from the west and struck
the ranch. It might be the name came from a
washout that happened some time ago. They
don’t get much rain in this region, but once in a
long time there’s a regular cloudburst and a
flood.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy might have tried to keep the conversation
going, for there were a number of things he
wanted to ask the scout master; but it happened
that the obstreperous calico pony developed a
streak of ugliness just about that time and, consequently,
Jimmy had all he could do to manage
the beast so as to keep his seat in the cowboy
saddle.</p>

<p class='c008' >The sun had set shortly after they started
away from the ranch, and the sky took on the
brightest red colors that could be imagined. But
neither of the boys felt in a humor to admire the
view. They had business on their hands of a
nature to engross their every thought—Jimmy,
with the control of his vicious mottle mount;
and Ned, in calculating what the ill-natured
suspect might attempt, in order to outwit those
who were pitted against him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Night settles down promptly after sunset in
this far southern country, there being very little
gloaming, such as people living in more northern
latitudes are accustomed to. But as the moon
was due to peep above the eastern horizon in
short time this was not apt to give them any
trouble.</p>

<p class='c008' >Besides, Chunky and his riders knew every
rod of the plain and could easily avoid such
places, where the prairie dogs had their underground
homes and which have been the means
of breaking the legs of many valuable horses.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had already noticed how careful Chunky
was to keep in a certain position on the gallop.
Here he could watch Sloper and at the same time
be ready to draw quickly upon him should the
suspect attempt any crooked business.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He doesn’t trust the man any further than
he can see him,” Ned was telling himself, as he
noticed this game that was being played between
the two men; and, at the same time, he meant
to try and keep his own eye on the slippery customer,
in so far as the conditions would allow.</p>

<p class='c008' >The evening star shone in the western sky and
they were making in a straight line away from it,
Ned noticed. This told him what the course was.
While Jimmy was apparently paying not the
least attention to such things, content to trust
himself in the hands of the puncher guide, Ned
believed in knowing for himself. There might
arise an occasion where he would be thrown on
his own resources; and, in such an event, it
would be a valuable asset to know just which
way to head, in order to fetch up at the ranch
house.</p>

<p class='c008' >That was scout tactics and scout practice—being
prepared against possible need.</p>

<p class='c008' >And now over the low rim in the far east,
where the squatty hills lay against the sky line,
a yellow glow began to appear. It was the moon
rising to fulfill a night’s vigil as sentinel while
men slept.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned greeted it as an old friend, and Jimmy,
too, expressed his satisfaction over seeing it
come upon the scene, for Jimmy and darkness
never did agree, and that was one reason he
always wanted to keep the fire burning through
the night while in camp, during the period when
there was no moon.</p>

<p class='c008' >As they drew closer to the hills, Ned began to
calculate just about how many miles they would
have to drive the herd once they managed to
round it up and get it on the run for home. He
knew from what he had been told that what had
taken them not more than an hour to cover, as
the crow flies, would mean at least four times
that length of time with the cattle.</p>

<p class='c008' >Perhaps, they would not be in until midnight
had come and gone. And who could say what
might not happen in the long interval.</p>

<p class='c008' >He wondered how far the rustlers were ready
to go, in order to run off a herd that had excited
their cupidity and, whether in case they happened
to come up while the punchers were busily
engaged, they might not attempt something like
a stampede, hoping to frighten the few cowboys
off, when they could make way with the cattle.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m glad we brought our rifles along with
us,” Ned was telling himself, as he studied out
these things and tried to imagine what it would
seem like to actually find himself engaged in a
regular battle with cattle thieves.</p>

<p class='c008' >He urged his pony forward enough to bring
him close to Chunky.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How much further do we have to go,
Chunky?” Ned inquired.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Be there in about ten minutes or so,” came
the reply. “Gotter kinder sheer off a bit
hereabouts on ’count of them ornery marmots
what makes it unsafe for a pony to run over
their holes. Been tryin’ to clean this village
out a long time, but they seem too smart for
the hull lot o’ us. If so be ye wanter practice
usin’ a rifle ye’ll find plenty to shoot at in
knockin’ these little runts over; and do the
stockmen a big favor in the bargin.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll remember that,” Ned told him, though
he rather fancied that during their stay at
Double Cross Ranch he and his three chums
would want to do most of their hunting for
larger game than poor little harmless prairie
dogs.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy had forged ahead slightly, or rather his
impatient and ambitious mount had taken the
bit in its mouth and pulled a little harder than
usual. It may have been accident, but to Ned
it seemed as though Ally Sloper must have some
vicious idea in his mind when he suddenly
flung his quirt vigorously out, apparently
intending to give his own pony a cruel cut,
and then struck the calico mount ridden by
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >Perhaps he thought to create a little excitement
if the beast ran away with its rider,
during which he might find a chance to slip
off unobserved. Ned, as quick as a flash, dug
his heels into his own pony, and was alongside
Jimmy almost as soon as the spotted beast
started to leap wildly forward under the impetus
of that blow from the quirt, something he had
never stood for in the past.</p>

<p class='c008' >When he bent down and seized hold of the
bridle close to the pony’s mouth Ned was
uttering soothing words. Between his efforts
and those of the rider, the pony was kept from
bolting, though it snorted and acted ugly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m afraid you’ll have to pay dear for
picking out that calico nag, Jimmy,” Ned told
his chum, when they were riding along side by
side after the little matter had been settled for
the time being.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Tis too late to make any difference,” replied
the other scout; “and do you remember tellin’
me once that it’s no time to change mounts when
crossin’ a stream? Now that I’ve started on this
painted pony I’ll stick to the same through
good winds and foul. If the little cayuse c’n
dump me, he’s welcome to try, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Evidently Jimmy’s old stubborn nature was
on deck again. He did hate to give anything up
the worst kind; though he admitted that there
were some exceptions to this rule and one of
them was whenever he found himself on a
sickening heaving sea.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I hope the cattle will be found feedin’ in
the place they called a coulie?” Jimmy went on
to say a minute later, as he strove earnestly
to make out the conformation of the low hills
they were approaching.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now Ned had just been wondering on his
own account what Chunky expected to do in
case the herd had wandered away. Would he
start to follow them, making use of his training
as a tracker in order to stick to the trail the animals
would have left behind them?</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned believed so. He had studied the lanky
puncher well, and found evidences of great
pertinacity in his make-up. Chunky would
not be the one to quit easily. On the contrary,
Ned felt positive he would keep moving if it
took the remainder of that night.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Chances are they’ll not wander far away,
Jimmy,” he told the other scout, who was
evidently beginning to cross bridges before he
came to them, as was his habit, and so attempt
more or less unnecessary work.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I don’t hear any signs of the critters,
do you, Ned?” continued Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why no, and you couldn’t hardly expect to,
what with all the noise we’re making,” Ned
replied, shortly; “though the wind is coming
almost in our faces, and seems like we might
hear if a bull bellowed. But leave all that to
Chunky. He knows what to do, Jimmy. Just
look out for your pony, and keep close by;
that’s all you’ve got to do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Gradually the hills assumed more shape, and
they could even make out the trees that covered
their sides in most quarters.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That dark place ahead must be the coulie
opening,” Ned suggested.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what it is,” replied the lanky rider,
“You foller it up a ways and all of a sudden-like
you drop in on one of the finest little valleys
that cattle ever nosed about in, knee-high in
grass that ain’t the buffalo stripe neither, and
with a fine spring that sends its water down the
hull place. We ain’t got anythin’ ekal to it for
a harbor for cattle this side o’ the Colorado.
That’s why we turned our prize herd in here,
to pick up a little fat before the Kunnel he ships
the same off to a show.”</p>

<p class='c008' >That was quite a long talk for Chunky to
make. He was a man of few words as a rule
and bit his sentences off as though it pained
him to run on for any great length of time.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned understood. And he was glad that he
had come with the man who was now temporarily
in charge of Double Cross Ranch. Where
Chunky happened to be things were more apt
to take place than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now it was very likely that the waiting
rustlers must have known all about this unusually
fine herd. Even if they had failed to
locate it on their own account, while galloping
around the country, Ally Sloper would
have put them wise.</p>

<p class='c008' >If they were figuring on making way with
any portion of the Double Cross property
shortly, it stood to reason that they would turn
their attention first of all to this valuable drove.</p>

<p class='c008' >The moon had risen above the horizon and
was pouring a flood of light upon the scene.
Ned could not remember when it had appeared
more radiant. He fancied that they would have
very little trouble in making the round-up and
drive, if only nothing happened to break up
their well laid plans.</p>

<p class='c008' >No doubt when they had arrived at the bottom
of the coulie Chunky would order a short halt,
in order to let the ponies get their wind again.
And during that time they could be using their
ears to catch any sounds that might come from
up the gully, such as the mooing of cows that
had calves, the bellowing of a bull, or the
clashing as horns beat against horns in a fierce fight
for possession.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sloper was still in line. He had not turned
his face once toward Chunky since starting from
the ranch, and it was natural that he should be
laboring under a high tension, possibly arranging
scheme after scheme, only to cast them away
when he discovered weak points.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned believed the fellow was only waiting to
see what circumstances would do for him; and
he felt that should the opening come he would be
as quick as a flash to avail himself of it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Well, here they were now at the foot of the
hills, and apparently their fast gallop must be
near its end. Jimmy would not be sorry.
He was sore with being bounced about in that
hard saddle, though no one could have forced
him to admit that he was having anything but
a glorious time. But Jimmy was always full
of grit, and disdained to call for help unless it
could not possibly be avoided. He would
master that fancy calico pony, or know the
reason why.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold up!”</p>

<p class='c008' >When Chunky called this out every one drew
rein. They were undoubtedly in the mouth of
a coulie, which was merely a gully through
which at various times in the ages that had
passed floods had swept down the side of the
hills, and following a set course washed this bed
clear. Later on bushes and even trees had managed
to obtain a foothold and seemed to thrive.</p>

<p class='c008' >The horses were breathing heavily, as the
six riders sat in their saddles and listened
eagerly to catch any sounds that might come
down from the feeding plateau above.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was no lack of noise, as the two scouts
quickly understood. And if cattle made all
those sounds while feeding Ned wondered what
it would be under stress of excitement and
panic, when stampeded by a storm, or from some
other cause.</p>

<p class='c008' >He could hear much trampling, low bellowing,
the mooing of cows fearful lest they be separated
from their calves, and a confusion of other
sounds of which, being more or less of a greenhorn
on the range, he could make nothing.</p>

<p class='c008' >But it was different with Chunky and the
other punchers. Their trained ears, accustomed
to detecting even uneasiness in feeding stock,
and guessing the cause, instantly picked up
several things that told them the startling
truth.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Ned himself plainly heard the neigh of
an excited horse, and then what appeared to
be a half suppressed shout, he jumped to a
sudden conclusion that very nearly took his
breath away.</p>

<p class='c008' >Something not down on the hills was certainly
going on up there, where the prize herd fed.
There were men there and they were stirring up
the cattle, for the snap of whips could be heard
together with various other sounds such as Ned
fancied might accompany the start of a drive.</p>

<p class='c008' >He could give a pretty good guess what it all
meant, and did not have to wait for Chunky to
pass the information along. Some other persons
besides themselves had taken a notion
to start a round-up that was not ordered, and
right then were busily engaged in getting things
moving.</p>

<p class='c008' >Apparently the punchers had not arrived any
too soon, for the rustlers were undoubtedly
abroad; and had the range riders been delayed
another half hour they must have arrived at
Washout Coulie to find the feeding grounds
bare, and discover that the herd had mysteriously
vanished!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />STAMPEDING THE PRIZE BUNCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Steady, Ally, and don’t try it!” Chunky was
saying in a low but tense voice. He seemed to
have suspected that the treacherous puncher
would be greatly excited over the fact that his
friends were at work above, and might take
considerable chances in order to let them know
the men from the Double Cross had arrived on
the scene of action unannounced.</p>

<p class='c008' >They gathered in a little clump. The other
two punchers must have guessed why Chunky
was acting in this way toward Sloper, for they
eyed the latter suspiciously, and Ned could see
that Arizona Tom had his heavy gun in his hand,
as though ready to use it promptly should the
other try to dash away without authority.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seems like we didn’t get here any to soon,
hey, Ned?” ventured Jimmy, with one of his
hoarse whispers.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Same old luck keeps after us,” was the reply
of the scout master; “as long as that holds good
I should worry more for the other fellow than
on our account.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s them pesky rustlers that have hit up
a hot pace, and got on the ground ahead o’
us,” Chunky was growling; and then, as though
his humor changed, he went on to add: “but
say, mebbe we won’t give ’em the surprise o’
their lives.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then you’ll tackle the bunch, even if they
number more than we do?” asked Ned, seeking
information while they waited for a move on the
part if those who were so busily engaged up
the coulie.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shucks! it wouldn’t stop us if they was three
to our one,” Chunky answered, with the freedom
from concern that usually marks the true
cowman. “If we can surprise the critters the
advantage’ll lie with us. And let me say right
now that it won’t be safe for any feller to get gay,
and give a yip, or let his gun go off by accident,
’cause another is apt to drop into the habit,
which is a bad one.”</p>

<p class='c008' >That last was undoubtedly meant for Ally
Sloper. He could be heard gnashing his strong
white teeth in sullen anger, but he did not
venture to let out a warning whoop so as to
tell his friends they were up against it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned could not blame him, for he fancied that
it might have been the last shout Ally would
ever make, because this was a serious business,
betraying the interests of his employer, and
should he be shot no blame would ever be
attached to the one carrying out the punishment.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Move over this way a leetle,” said Chunky,
presently, as though he knew just how the
cattle and their drivers must issue forth from
the mouth of the coulie when the time came,
and meant to set the trap so as to take the
rustlers off their guard.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whew! tell me about this, will you?”
Jimmy was breathing in the ear of his companion
scout, as they tried to keep their ponies
quiet, sitting in the shadow of the trees, and
listening to all the clamor that arose further up
the slope of the hill.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If you think this is exciting, Jimmy,”
remarked Ned, “wait till the climax comes
along, and then see what happens. To think
of our getting in a lively affair like this the very
first night we’re at the ranch. And somebody
said all the fun was in the past. Looks like we
find it wherever we go.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, you never spoke truer words, Ned,”
admitted Jimmy; “and honest now, I’m tremblin’
all over right at this minute, not because I’m
scared a whiff, for you know I ain’t, but just
on account of the strain. Oh! I hope they
don’t take a notion to slip away up the coulie
’stead of droppin’ down and takin’ their medicine
like men.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Listen! they’re coming, I do believe, Jimmy!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sounds like it, Ned. I never had the pleasure
of handin’ it out to a cattle rustler, but I’ve
heard they are pretty tough citizens; and in
case I do have to puncture a few with disabling
wounds it needn’t keep me awake nights.
Them longhorns has got to be saved, and we’re
here to do it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Stow your gab, Jimmy, and be ready to do
what you’re told. Chunky gives the orders for
the entertainment, remember, and be quick
to act. Yes, the cattle have been headed
this way. They’re running down the coulie
right now!”</p>

<p class='c008' >With the increasing noise the excitement
grew apace. Both scouts shut their teeth hard
together, and awaited the breaking of the
crisis. The oncoming herd was drawing closer
with every second that passed. Undoubtedly
those who were driving them out of the feeding
ground knew that this was the only way by
means of which the herd could be started,
because further up the coulie merged into a
blind canyon that must have proven a trap.</p>

<p class='c008' >If there had been the slightest doubt in any
one’s mind before now concerning the truth,
it would have been dissipated when the loud
voices of men came floating down, with the crash
of many cloven hoofs and the protestations
from the unwilling cattle, doubtless preparing to
settle down for the night when this drive was
started.</p>

<p class='c008' >Chunky must have been aware of the fact that
it would be next to impossible to keep watch
over Ally Sloper when the crisis dawned. Perhaps
he really did not care so much, whether the
other escaped or not, since he could no longer
upset the plans they had laid, by giving warning.</p>

<p class='c008' >And on his part Sloper may have figured that
he could not afford to openly prove himself
a traitor by fleeing. He could not know that they
had any positive proof of his double dealing,
and just suspicion he could live down. So he
might even act as though he were an honest
man and carry out his part in the work of saving
the threatened herd. His life counted for more
than the success of his allies in the raid. He
could make new connections with other schemers;
but once he had been strung up to a telegraph
pole by furious punchers he could not get
a new life.</p>

<p class='c008' >The noise grew more distinct, and at any
minute now Ned expected to see a mass of moving
animals come out of the dark mouth of the
coulie.</p>

<p class='c008' >He took it for granted that the cattle raiders
were to be treated harshly, for he knew what a
contempt honest punchers felt toward those
who would carry off four-footed property
belonging to others, and changing the brand, sell
it as if it were their own.</p>

<p class='c008' >That meant more or less gunfire; it might be
that wounds would be received as well as given,
for these rustlers were a dare-devil lot, and no
doubt ready to fight desperately before giving
up their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p class='c008' >This did not cause Ned to quail. He had
received his baptism of fire long ago, and for
one of his age had been through so much of
excitement that he might almost be called a
veteran. Nevertheless he was thrilled with the
thought of surprising the thieves, and his heart
beat much more rapidly than usual as he sat
in his saddle, keeping a firm grip on his pony,
and holding his rifle ready for quick action.</p>

<p class='c008' >Yes, they are coming very fast now. The clatter
of cloven hoofs, and all those other accompanying
sounds, told this plainly. Ned wondered how
many of the raiders there might turn out to be.
He tried to count the different kinds of shouts
and whoops, but found this next to impossible.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What does it matter,” he told himself,
finally; “just as Chunky said, if we take them
by surprise the advantage is all with us? Five
or ten, we’ll send them flying over the plain,
thinking they’ve run foul of the whole Double
Cross outfit. Jimmy, when the time comes to cut
loose yelpt like a Fiji Islander, or anything else
that makes a big noise; get that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You wait,” was all Jimmy replied, but there
was a world of meaning back of the words,
and Ned knew he would do his duty.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There they come!” said one of the cow
punchers just then.</p>

<p class='c008' >Out from the shadows of the coulie burst a
string of cattle on the run. They had been
started with difficulty, but once the excitement
began to work there would be no restraining
them until weariness caused them to stop
their flight.</p>

<p class='c008' >Chunky was eagerly watching to see how they
turned. He doubtless anticipated that one or
more of the rustlers would be seeking to head off,
and then would be the time to open fire, so as to
create a small-sized panic among the cattle
raiding crowd.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz! but I’m awonderin’ what this
beast’ll do when I let go with the gun right over
his head!” Jimmy remarked just about that
time, which seemed to indicate that he believed
he had cause for worry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Keep a tight hold of your bridle; that’s
all you can do,” the scout master advised,
without removing his eyes from the picture that
was enlarging with each passing second, as more
cattle came running out of the coulie, and followed
the leaders.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the midst of the lowing herd there
suddenly burst two horsemen. They were
swinging their hats, waving their arms, and
evidently shouting at the top of their shrill
voices, with the object of turning the running
herd in the direction they wished it to go.</p>

<p class='c008' >Many miles lay between Washout Coulie and
the ranch buildings, and there was little danger
that this racket might be carried there on the
wings of the wind; even though it were faintly
heard, chances were that the punchers would
conclude not to bother, under the impression
that it must be a round-up on some neighboring
stock farm.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now! give’em Hail Columbia!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned could hear Chunky shouting these words,
or something that sounded very similar. He
was paying little attention to anything that was
said, however, for his whole mind seemed to be
taken up with following the rapid drama that
was being unfolded before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >There began to sound the discharge of firearms.
Arizona Tom, Dutch and Chunky each
took a shot, and Jimmy not to be outdone,
managed to get his gun half-way to his shoulder
before he pulled the trigger. Then his calico
pony began to act in such an extraordinary
manner that it took all Jimmy’s attention, and
for the time being he did not care a particle
whether the two rustlers ran away, or were made
to bite the dust, for it was a case of winding his
arms around the neck of that bucking broncho
or else measuring his length on the ground, after
flying for a dozen or two feet through the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008' >The rustlers might never have known they were
being fired upon if it depended on the noise alone;
but then there was the flash of the several discharges;
and the whistle of flying lead past
their ears to warn them of the fact that they were
in the danger zone.</p>

<p class='c008' >They looked that way and must have made a
discovery that was far from pleasant. Still
they were not ready to give up so easily, when it
had seemed that everything was coming their
way.</p>

<p class='c008' >“They mean to make a fight for the prize!”
Ned told himself, when the saw a sudden flash
from the spot where the two rustlers had been
mixing with the herd, and which must mean that
one of them was using his gun.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that he raised his rifle. Others of the lawless
tribe would be pushing into view shortly,
and it was policy to scatter them in the start,
so as to cut down the advantage they would have
from greater numbers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had never learned how to shoot from the
back of a prancing pony; but he was able to
use good judgment, and pull the trigger when
there was a temporary lull in operations.</p>

<p class='c008' >He must have managed to strike the mount of
one of the rustlers, much to his regret, for
immediately it started madly off, despite all efforts
of the rider to hold the beast in. The other man
finding that he alone faced the fire of the enemy
made haste to tum and flee.</p>

<p class='c008' >This, however, was only the beginning. There
were others near by, and loud yells attested that
they were about to burst into view, when the
whole operation must be repeated.</p>

<p class='c008' >Meanwhile the cattle continued to pour in
a living stream out of the coulie. No wonder
these reckless rustlers had taken great chances
in order to secure this bunch, which consisted
of the pick of the Double Cross herds. They had
undoubtedly been kept in close touch with all
that was going on by the spies who were employed
on the ranch, and doubtless knew the number and
value of each separate herd.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then came whooping riders, this time some half
dozen, scattered about so as to cover considerable
ground. In the bright moonlight the picture
was a thrilling one, and Ned believed he must
often recall it in future days. The surging
longhorns, the active cow ponies and their
riders keeping up a continual racket, which
seemed to be an essential part of the performance—all
these impressed Ned greatly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then he heard a loud explosion close to his
head.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Give it to the night riders! Let ’em have hot
lead! Show ’em how the boys of Double Cross
Ranch can stand up for Kunnel Job!”</p>

<p class='c008' >With each short sentence Chunky was discharging
his gun; and as the others kept pace
with his activity there was a warm session
around that quarter. Even Ally Sloper added
to the din by shooting several times, and yelling,
though Ned saw if none of the others did, that
he aimed high, apparently not caring to take
the chances of hitting one of his friends.</p>

<p class='c008' >The utmost consternation attacked the surprised
rustlers. They must have fancied that
the whole force of the ranch was upon them, if
noise counted for anything.</p>

<p class='c008' >One man was seen to sway in his saddle, so
that another had to help hold him in his seat.
Ned himself felt sure that with one of his shots
he had wounded another rustler in the arm,
for he changed the bridle grip to the other hand,
and dashed off at full swing, plainly demoralized.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was no holding them, because they knew
they were in the wrong, and that if their identity
chanced to be discovered, in spite of the bandanas
with which the lower part of their faces were
concealed, the law would step in and deal with
them harshly.</p>

<p class='c008' >And so it came about that the raid on the
Double Cross herd turned out to be a fizzle;
though only for the prompt way in which the
defenders of the prize herd started out to meet
the situation there must have been a different
story to tell.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get the cattle headed for home!” was the
slogan that went the rounds; and with Chunky
still keeping close to the suspect this difficult
job was undertaken. Being experts at the
rounding-up process they soon had the herd
headed off, and started on a new tack, now
making in the direction of the ranch home.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had meant to lend a hand at this work,
but something that came up kept him from
taking any great interest in the driving of the
steers and cows. This was the strange disappearance
of his chum, Jimmy McGraw!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />JIMMY’S UNWILLING RIDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >There was reason for alarm, Ned thought, when
he made this discovery. The last he could
remember seeing Jimmy was just at the time the
second detachment of the cattle rustlers came
bursting out from the coulie, with shouts and all
the wild clamor cow punchers indulge in when
driving stock.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that time Jimmy seemed to have tamed
down his calico pony enough to once more
think of using his Marlin on the enemy; but
strive as he might Ned could not remember
having heard its suggestive “cough” to tell that
Jimmy had actually pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c008' >It must have been at that exciting moment,
when everything was confused, and Ned had his
attention fastened on the movements of the cattle
poachers, that the thing happened.</p>

<p class='c008' >He knew Jimmy too well to even suspect that
the other would run away voluntarily, for Jimmy
dearly loved a “scrap,” though trying to
conform to scout rules, and avoid seeking trouble.
This would of course mean that the frantic
calico pony with the white eyes and furious
temper had taken the bit between his teeth, and
actually run away with the scout.</p>

<p class='c008' >How could they tell which way the animal
had gone in making his headlong flight? Would
he be apt to head for home, or else try and
join the horses of the fleeing rustlers?</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned determined to speak to Chunky about it.
The puncher might be able to offer good advice
in the matter, seeing that he had spent all his
life on the plains, and knew the habits of these
tricky bronchos from the ground up.</p>

<p class='c008' >Chunky, however, was a difficult man to
approach just then, for he certainly had his hands
full in getting the big herd turned toward the
ranch house, and at the same time trying to
keep the suspect under his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >If Ned had only had his little electric torch with
him he would have gotten down and examined the
soil, endeavoring to get some pointers by learning
in which direction the calico pony had fled.</p>

<p class='c008' >All he could really do was to help drive the
cattle home, and make up his mind that if poor
Jimmy failed to show up during the remainder
of the night, he would return again in the morning
and do his best to follow the trail of the runaway.</p>

<p class='c008' >He pictured the scene, with Jimmy, who was
not in the class of champion riders at all, clinging
to the neck of his mount, and trying to soothe
the frantic beast by soft words, which must,
however, have fallen on deaf ears.</p>

<p class='c008' >When before leaving the spot Ned discovered
some object shining amidst the bunches of
buffalo grass, and jumping down found that it
was indeed Jimmy’s prized repeating rifle, he
knew that his guess must be close to the truth.</p>

<p class='c008' >Unless he wanted to be left behind he must
be moving, for already had the energetic Chunky
and his mates managed to turn the cattle in the
right direction and the whole mass was swinging
toward home. The herd, however, went unwillingly,
doubtless disliking to quit their pasturage,
and suspecting it was to be followed by some sort
of irksome confinement, remembered only too
well from times past.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned would not soon forget that long and tiresome
drive.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not only did the punchers have their work
cut out for them in keeping the herd compact,
and constantly moving toward the region where
the building would finally heave in sight, but
they had another duty at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was no telling what the discomfited
rustlers might not attempt. If after their
temporary panic they managed to get together
and compare notes, doubtless they would realize
that they outnumbered the punchers who had
taken the prize herd away from them so neatly
and expeditiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >In their anger they might even follow, and start
hostile operations on a more savage and
determined scale, with the intention of recovering
their lost plunder. These cattle thieves had been
getting bolder than ever of late, and there could
be no telling what they might not attempt.</p>

<p class='c008' >Consequently Chunky had given orders to his
men to keep their guns “on tap,” and to make
quick use of the same, given any opportunity.
They were thus compelled to keep on guard all
the while they shouted, and chased after such
steers or cows as manifested a desire to break
away from the main herd.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once he caught the spirit of the thing Ned was
in his element, and the puncher afterwards
admitted that the boy acted as though he had
been accustomed to driving herd all his life.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, with so few hands, and such a wide
field to cover, it now became practically impossible
for Chunky to keep close to Ally Sloper.
He saw that the other appeared to be engaging
in the diversion with all his accustomed vim,
and it had to go at that. If the man failed to
turn up when they reached the stockade, why
they would be well rid of a faithless employee,
that was all. It was too late now for any traitor
to spoil their work by hunting up his allies and
telling what he knew.</p>

<p class='c008' >Apparently Sloper must have been figuring
things out, and concluded to risk it further by
sticking to the Double Cross outfit. He did not
know just how far suspicion may have gone;
but if he disappeared now his guilt would be
taken for granted, and his usefulness as a spy
gone.</p>

<p class='c008' >So Ned noticed every little while that the man
was working with all his accustomed zeal, as
though to counteract any suspicion that might
have been aroused concerning his loyalty.</p>

<p class='c008' >Indeed, Ned more than once took pattern from
the actions of Sloper, who had few equals and
no superiors at the work. It seemed a shame
that so expert a cowman should ruin his career
by playing a double game with his employers.</p>

<p class='c008' >It took them several hours to get the herd
near home, for as a chain is only as strong as
its weakest link so cattle may be driven only as
fast as the cows and calves can run.</p>

<p class='c008' >The strain eased up considerably when they
drew nearer the ranch buildings, for the possibility
of their being pounced upon became less.
At a distance of ten or twelve miles the dashing
rustlers could afford to take chances; but not
so near home. Once that hard-riding bunch of
punchers started in their wake and the cattle
thieves knew what was bound to follow; for
saddles would be emptied ruthlessly, and no
quarter shown. To the cattleman they were
looked upon as snakes in the grass, and treated
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had lots of time to indulge in serious
reflections as he rode along, now urging his pony
to the right, and again to the left, as occasion
demanded, in order to keep the main body of
advancing cattle intact.</p>

<p class='c008' >Besides thoughts of the lost chum, Jimmy, he
found himself wondering whether the man whom
the Government officials had asked him to look
out for, Clem Parsons, could have been one of
those whom he saw wildly chasing the stolen
cattle; also if the deep-throated voice that had
bellowed out from time to time belonged to the
awful Hy Adams, step-father to Amos, and ferocious
mate to the shrinking little woman he and
the other scouts had met and pitied so much.</p>

<p class='c008' >If this were so he began to speculate as to just
how he might get in touch with the man who was
wanted on many back charges by the Secret Service
people. Doubtless these cattle thieves had a
secret den somewhere among the hills, to which
they repaired between daring raids. If Clem
Parsons had indeed cast his fortunes in with
the gang it began to look as though of a necessity
Ned would have to look up this hiding-place,
risky proceeding though that would seem.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then his mind would turn again to Jimmy.
What if the latter had fallen in with some of the
defeated rustlers, would they treat him decently,
or be apt to vent their spite upon his head
because of their recent bitter disappointment?</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned found himself wishing again and again
it were all over, and that he knew the worst.
The closer they drew to the stockade the more
he found his nerves quivering with suspense.
If Jimmy were not there he realized he was in
for a very bad night, and that sleep was not
apt to visit his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >The moon was now high up in the star-dotted
sky, showing that some hours must have elapsed
since the encounter with the bold cattle thieves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Every chance Ned got he strained his eyes
to learn if there were any hopeful signs ahead.
But bright though the moon may seem, so that
one could even read fine print in a newspaper
held close to the eyes, it is always deceptive,
and low-lying objects fail to disclose themselves
until they are quite near.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a moving light that finally told Ned how
close the herd was to the ranch buildings. Then
he caught answering shouts, and eagerly he
listened in the hope of distinguishing the well-known
voice of Jimmy among the whoops;
but although once or twice he thought he detected
it, he could not be sure.</p>

<p class='c008' >The gates of the big enclosure were open and
ready to receive the cattle, with the Chinese
cook in attendance. It only required a little
expert work in getting the leading steers to enter,
and after that the job was easy.</p>

<p class='c008' >Seeing that his services were no longer required,
and with an aching heart, Ned wheeled
his pony and started for the long building known
as the bunkhouse, beyond which lay the other
structures.</p>

<p class='c008' >As he did so he discovered a moving figure
advancing hastily toward him. Hope grappled
with doubt, and he was held in this mixture of
suspense until suddenly he heard a loud sound
that sent a spasm of joy to his heart.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a fair imitation of the long-drawn howl
of the wolf; and so many times had he drilled
Jimmy in making this signal of the patrol to
which both of them belonged that he knew his
missing chum was safe and sound, or he would
not be advancing toward him so sturdily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jimmy,” he shouted in a transport of joy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whoopee! on deck, Ned, and mighty glad it
is to see you comin’ back after that hullaballoo
of a time!” came the answer; and in another
minute the two scouts were shaking hands with
considerable vim.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I picked up your gun, Jimmy,” remarked
Ned, the first thing, “and here it is fastened to
my saddle.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Glory be, but that’s good news,” declared
the other, exultantly; “d’ye know I’ve been
feelin’ mighty sorry about that same gun, for
fear I’d lost it; and you know what I think of
the shootin’-stick. It was either drop everything,
and get me arms tight around the neck
of that blasted broncho, or else find myself
standin’ on me head. Gee whiz! but it was a mad
race the little villain gave me before he fetched
up here at the ranch house.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m sorry you didn’t have some of the fun
of driving the herd home,” remarked the scout
master; “but glad it was no worse than a
runaway. When I saw the white in the eyes of
that pretty calico pony I knew he had a nasty
temper. I suppose you’ll want another horse
after this?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What, me?” ejaculated Jimmy, bristling up
instantly; “is that the opinion you’ve got of
your old chum, Ned Nestor? Did you ever know
me to give anything up first pop? Well, I’ll
break that spotted little fiend in, or else he’ll
break my coco for me. And say, he’s goin’
to pay up for the run he took this night. I’ll
keep him goin’ till he’s ready to drop, and will
eat out of me hand. That’s Jimmy McGraw’s
way of doin’ things. The McGraws never say die
as long as there’s anything to eat in the house.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, let’s get back to the house, after I’ve
turned my pony loose in the corral where they
keep the saddle band. None of the others shown
up yet?” Ned continued.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not yet, though I think one of the herds
must be close by now, for I caught a whoop or
two a while back, and it didn’t come from your
quarter either,” Jimmy replied, walking beside
his chum, who had jumped to the ground, glad
of the chance to stretch his cramped legs after
such a tedious ride, to which he was not accustomed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You must have made record time getting
here, then, Jimmy?” the scout master observed,
and if he smiled at picturing the sight of his
companion hanging desperately to the neck of
the frantic runaway, Jimmy was not aware of
the fact.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Tis meself that beat the score that time,”
he remarked, proudly. “When I look back, all
I seem to remember is a rush, me arms fast
around the neck of the flying steed, and then him
entering the corral like a whirlwind. It was
whist, bang, and there I was miles away from the
fight with me heart near broke because I’d
been cheated out of the best part of the game.”</p>

<p class='c008' >When Ned remembered the arduous drive
that followed, with his voice husky from shouting,
and how his arms ached from waving his hat,
and managing his lively mount, he secretly
thought Jimmy had been a lucky chap, though
he did not say so.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And you couldn’t find a mount to come back
on, I suppose?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That I couldn’t,” replied Jimmy. “The
saddle horse corral was plumb empty; and there
wasn’t a puncher around to lend me his broncho.
I even thought to walk out and meet ye on
the way, but was afraid I’d get lost and give
heaps of trouble. But glory be, you won the
day, and saved the prize herd, which ought to
please the Colonel when he hears about the
same.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Having disposed of his mount Ned, together
with Jimmy, started for the house, intending to
settle down in an easy chair and not move
until he went to bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >There could be no doubt but what one of the
other herds was coming in, for the clamor of the
drive was in full swing. It had been thought
that Chunky and his party might be the last
to arrive, as they had further to go; but unexpected
difficulties must have delayed the others,
or else they found themselves unable to push
their herds as rapidly as Ned’s party had done.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was laughing softly to himself as they
sat there, waiting the turn of events.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What strikes you as so funny, Jimmy?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” replied the other scout, “I was only
thinkin’ how little we can see further than
our noses. Now, only a bit ago some of us
began to complain that the excitement was all
in the past. But say, look what we’ve run up
against before we’ve been in this country of the
cattle rustlers a single day. Can you beat it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >And Ned, as he looked back at the strange
events marking the last twenty-four hours, was
compelled to admit that Jimmy was right;
for they had certainly never met with a more
thrilling series of happenings than those which had
come their way. And it also seemed as though
the end was not yet; for there still remained to
be carried out his business affair in connection
with the man who was wanted so badly by the
Secret Service people at Washington.</p>

<p class='c008' >As they sat there and exchanged remarks,
the noise grew in volume, and presently from
three quarters at once moving objects began
to loom up, that soon developed into the expected
droves. From which it would seem that success
had accompanied the Double Cross punchers in
every round-up, and that the herds were all safe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />AFTER THE RUSTLERS’ RAID.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >As the other herds came in the excitement grew
intense. Cattle were lowing, men shouting and
horses whinnying at such a rate that the two
boys changing their mind, had to make their
way out to the corral to see the last of the great
drive by moonlight.</p>

<p class='c008' >By degrees things quieted down, though there
would be more or less uneasiness manifested
among the impounded cattle throughout the
night.</p>

<p class='c008' >The punchers were a noisy lot. Dozens of
questions flowed in upon Chunky, Dutch and the
other two who managed to bring in the prize herd.
This was after the news was circulated that the
rustlers had been in the act of making off with
the cattle in Washout Coulie at the time the
Double Cross boys arrived on the scene.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was much bitter lamentation heard
among the unlucky ones, because they had been
cheated out of all the fun. They could have a
drive at any time, but a genuine encounter with
the bold rustlers was something worth while.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned saw that Ally Sloper was playing his part
as though he meant to rehabilitate himself in
the good graces of the owners of the ranch after
his recent unfortunate break. He even boasted
of having wounded at least a couple of the cattle
thieves with his fire; though Ned knew only
too well that this was untrue, since the other
had shot too high for any such damage to follow.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s got his nerve with him, seems like,”
Jimmy had remarked, as having been joined by
Harry and Jack, he and Ned stood there watching
the last of the cattle being driven into the big
enclosure that would be patrolled during the
remainder of the night, so that nothing could
happen to break the corral fence and scatter the
inmates over the plain.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s more than Lefty Louie had then,”
remarked Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He went out with your crowd, didn’t he?”
Ned asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Went out, yes, but he didn’t come back with
us,” replied the other scout.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh! I just thought that sneak would beat
it, given half a chance,” said Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c008' >“One of the first things I did,” Harry spoke
up, “after getting in was to hunt around to see
if the other three came back; and not a sign can
you find of one of the bunch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean Coyote Smith, Bob Caruso and
Tinplate George?” Ned inquired.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All slipped away the first chance they got,”
Harry continued, in a disgusted voice. “I
guess they must have seen that the game was
up, and thought they might have to swing from
some telegraph pole if the punchers took a notion
they’d played fast and loose.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can you blame them?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, perhaps not so much; and besides,
it cleans out the sneaky element among the
punchers of the Double Cross outfit,” Harry
admitted. “But Uncle Job will have a heap to
hear when he gets back from his journey. You
don’t think those men will dare come close in
here and try to steal the cattle right out of the
corral, do you, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I should say there wasn’t one risk in a thousand
that way,” answered the scout leader,
immediately; “they know that we’ll be on
guard, and chances are they’ve got too healthy
a respect for the shooting abilities of these
scrappy Double Cross punchers to want to get
into a regular fight with them.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But all the same Chunky means to keep on
the watch; he’ll have the stockade well guarded,
won’t he, Ned?” Harry continued.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That has all been arranged for,” Ned told
him; “and you can make up your mind there’ll
be nothing doing until morning. Fact is, I’m
more suspicious that Ally Sloper being up to
some sly trick than that his friends will dare
pounce down on the ranch in the night.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I hope Chunky hasn’t changed his mind
about that snake!” Jimmy ventured. “Just because
he helped drive the herd, and goes around
boasting how he did such great shakes in shooting
up the rustler gang, isn’t any proof that he’s
reformed.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Chunky is on to his capers, never you fear,
Jimmy,” declared Jack, “and ten to one he
means to have Sloper watched every minute of
the time till dawn. If he tries to slip away, he’ll
run up against a snag right off. It may be a
piece of lead that stops his exit, or the loop of a
lariat. You can count on seeing him among us
when the call to breakfast comes.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! I wish it was now!” Jimmy was heard
to mutter, “all this work seems to have made
me as hungry as a wolf; and it’s been an <i>awful</i>
long time since they flagged me to a meal.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Cheer up, Jimmy,” Ned told him, “because
I’ve got some good news for you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did the lady tell Chin Chin Charley to give
the boys some grub after they came in from the
drive, Ned; is that the good news you want to
tell me?” Jimmy eagerly demanded, looking
anxiously at his chum.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There goes the big gong right now,” interrupted
Jack, “and the boys are trooping for the
grub tent as if they know what to expect after
doing night duty. So get a move on, Jimmy;
if you don’t want to find everything cleared out
and only a bare table left.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was off like a flash. When the other
scouts entered the place where meals were
served, they discovered him busily at work.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Saved you places alongside me!” he called
out; “and say, there’s plenty of chow for everybody.
That Chink knows his business, and I’m
goin’ to be great friends with him all the time
we’re here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It takes you to make up to the cook, Jimmy,”
laughed Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s all right,” replied the other, with a
broad grin, “sure it’s a wise boy that knows
which side of his bread is buttered. And Chin
Chin Charley is the boss cook, let me tell you
right now. I ain’t much in that line myself,
but then I know a good thing when I run across
it. And don’t the rest of you get jealous if you
see how thick me’n him are expectin’ to be;
ain’t we, Chin Chin?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The slant-eyed Mongolian must have already
taken quite a liking for jolly, good-natured Jimmy,
for upon being thus appealed to he nodded
his head until his pigtail bobbed up and down,
smiled affably, and was heard to murmur:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Much good frien’s, Jimmy, me; heap like
Melicanboy; much eat; come back more many
times, alle samee!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Apparently Jimmy was in for a good time
while staying at the Double Cross Ranch, and he
believed in starting things right by making sure
that the food supply would be unlimited.</p>

<p class='c008' >After the midnight supper had been disposed
Of the punchers strolled forth again. Ned and
Chunky were in consultation, for the puncher,
knowing that Mrs. Haines had somehow conceived
the idea that the young scout leader had
a long head for a boy and could be depended on
in an emergency, realized that it was the right
thing to put certain things up to him. Of
course, Chunky knew best what should be done,
and Ned quickly told him to exercise his own
judgment in the matter of guarding the big
stockade in which the cattle had been shut up.</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys were all tired after such a long and
arduous experience. Even Jack, who as a rule
could stand for almost anything, admitted that
he could hardly put one foot in front of the
other, he felt so stiff.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s because I’m not used to being so long
in the saddle and playing the game they have
out here,” he acknowledged, “but given a
chance, and we’ll show our friends, the punchers,
that scouts can ride pretty decently. I’m going
to pick up all the kinks of the job while I’m on
it; and before we leave here we ought to know
how to throw a rope, drop a steer, use the
branding iron on his flank, and ride the trickiest
broncho there is to a stand-still.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s me,” asserted Jimmy, like a flash.
“He’s a spotted little devil, too, and his name, sure
it’s Satan, or if it ain’t it ought to be. He beat
me out in the first clash and run me all the way
home, like a blue streak; but there’s another
day acomin’, don’t you forget it; and that score
between Jimmy McGraw and Satan has got to
be rubbed out. I’m on to his curves now and
I’ll sting him, or it’s me chased to the tall timber.
You hear me warble, boys!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then we’ll expect to have lots of fun out of
the circus, Jimmy,” said Harry, “because they’ve
been telling me that calico pony has got the
meanest name around here. Some of the boys
heard you boasting about how you could manage
any animal, and they just couldn’t help running
that beast in on you. But if Uncle Job had been
here I don’t think they’d have dared to take
the risk. You might have been killed.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He didn’t get me off and that’s some comfort,”
muttered Jimmy, grimly, “I’m a good
sticker, you see.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I noticed that it was hard work to get
you away from that table,” Jack remarked,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had been given comfortable quarters on
the ground floor, for the ranch house really
boasted of two stories in part. Cots took the
place of beds, but they seemed to be all that
might be desired; and, as Jack said, were a
thousand per cent better than the hard ground,
or the hot sand of the desert, which had been
their resting place ever since they left Los
Angeles, in that ramshackle automobile that had
played them false on the journey and had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was expected that the two owners of the
ranch would possibly return by the following
afternoon, when the stirring news could be told.
Until then Ned had considered that, perhaps,
no action should be taken in connection with
Ally Sloper, except that the suspect must be
kept under surveillance, so that he might not
damage the property in any way. The Colonel
would know how to deal with him though in all
probability a discharge would be the limit of his
punishment.</p>

<p class='c008' >The night passed without any alarm.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure they had a lesson they won’t forget for
some time,” Jimmy declared in the morning, as
the four scouts were talking matters over.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had had considerable trouble in coaxing
the said Jimmy to get out of his comfortable
bed. He declared in a sleepy voice that he had
been cheated out of much repose lately, and
needed rest the worst kind. Argument and
pleading seeming to have no effect, Ned finally
solemnly assured him that they would eat up
every bit of breakfast, no matter how they suffered
afterwards for it, unless he immediately
started dressing. That did the business, for
Jimmy believed Ned meant what he threatened,
and that there would be a famine in the land.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a fine morning and they enjoyed looking
out at the scene from the wide and long verandah.
The many buildings, the stockade now
filled with hundreds of the impounded stock, the
horse corrals where the ponies roamed when not
in use, or out grazing on the range—all these
and more made up a pleasant picture that
seemed to promise the boys a most enjoyable
time while at Double Cross Ranch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, Harry had some important business
to transact with his uncle but it was not going
to interfere at all with their having a great time.
It seemed that they had interested Mr. Stevens
in the ranch and its possibilities of enlargement,
with greater capital; and the well-to-do automobile
maker of New York City had sent his
son out to see what he thought of the idea, depending
wholly on Harry’s report as to whether
he went into the scheme or not.</p>

<p class='c008' >This being the case it was plain to be seen
that Harry was bound to be treated like a young
prince while he and his chums were at the ranch
and that nothing would be deemed too good for
them.</p>

<p class='c008' >As breakfast was not ready when the boys
issued forth, much to the disappointment of
Jimmy, who acted as though he had not eaten
for two days, they started to look around a little.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We might as well get acquainted with the
lay of things,” said Jack, “because it looks as if
we were going to hang out here some little time
now. And I want to say, in the beginning, that
I expect to be feeling right sore when the time
comes to tip our hats to Double Cross Ranch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy gave a grunt at hearing that.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s nothin’,” he asserted, with a twinkle
in his blue eyes, “seems to me all of us are pretty
much that way right now. And is it to be wondered
at, when we took a twenty-five mile run
last night without bein’ seasoned to the saddle.
But given time, and we’ll get as tough as any
puncher around. I think we’ve done right well
for a pack of greenhorns.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, your mentioning that word pack
makes me think of our burros and their loads,”
remarked Ned. “I wonder what became of
them.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I remember seeing one of the punchers leading
the donkeys into the stable,” Harry went on
to say, “and p’raps we might find them there.
Let’s stroll in and see if Teddy’d know us again,
the rascal.”</p>

<p class='c008' >And as the others were agreeable, they sauntered
over to the stable where some of the cowboys’
mounts were kept at times, and which
usually housed the saddles and other trappings
of the puncher band belonging to the ranch.</p>

<p class='c008' >It just happened by accident that all of the
scouts stopped talking as they approached the
long, low building, outside of which could be
seen the stout rail at which throughout the day
ponies could be seen hitched, sometimes as many
as a dozen or a score at a time.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was in the van, and as he stepped into
the doorway of the stable he came to a sudden
stop and held up his hand in a warning way that
the others instantly recognized as a signal for
them to halt in their tracks.</p>

<p class='c008' >No one said a single word, only Jimmy, who
was lagging along in the rear, pushed forward
as though anxious to get in line, so as to see what
it was that had excited the attention of the
scout master.</p>

<p class='c008' >A number of ponies were in the stalls, as well
as the donkeys that the boys had brought all
the way from Death Valley, and which they had
purchased from a party of dejected prospectors
desirous of returning home.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was a man there also, whose back was
turned toward them, but whom they immediately
recognized as Ally Sloper, the suspected
ally of the rustler gang. He had taken down
the three packs that came with the burros and
belonged to the scouts, and appeared to be
eagerly searching the same, evidently bent on
learning what they might contain.</p>

<p class='c008' >It happened that just at the very moment the
scouts stood there in the open doorway, Sloper
made a discovery that caused him to give vent
to a low cry of anger and amazement.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Ned saw what he held in his hand he
did not wonder that the spy was shocked. It
was nothing more nor less than the dead homing
pigeon the hawk had pounced on, and
which with its fateful message had afterwards
fallen into the possession of the four scouts, thus
putting them wise to the fact that there was
treachery afloat at the cattle ranch.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Ally Sloper saw the nature of his find
he understood how it came that his clever game
had gone against him so heavily, with the prize
herd saved from the rustlers’ raid.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />THE SHREWD OLD FOX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“He’s wise to the game!” Jimmy whispered
close to Ned’s ear, as they all stood and stared
at the puncher who held the dead carrier pigeon
in his hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >It must have been a great shock for Ally Sloper.
For the first time he realized just how suspicion
had come to fall upon his head; and with the
note which he had sent out fastened to the leg
of that same messenger bird in their possession,
those in charge of Double Cross Ranch during
the absence of the owners knew to a certainty of
his guilt.</p>

<p class='c008' >Some movement on the part of the scouts
must have told him he was being observed, for
he suddenly turned his head and looked straight
at them.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned knew there was danger of the baffled
conspirator becoming furiously angry and attempting
something wicked. He might be
ready to take all sorts of chances, if he could
but vent his rage upon those whom he suspected
must have been the main cause of his
defeat.</p>

<p class='c008' >It happened that Ned was holding his rifle in
his hands at the time, being about to clean it,
and he instinctively threw the muzzle of it forward,
so that he covered the puncher.</p>

<p class='c008' >Although Sloper had known that he was under
the ban, and suspicion directed toward him, as
yet no one had thought to take his gun away.
The weapon hung from his side where it could
be reached in a fraction of a second, should an
occasion suddenly arise calling for action.</p>

<p class='c008' >Knowing the clever way these cowmen have
of using their tools, Ned did not mean that he
and his chums should be made victims to the
ungovernable rage of a “caught in the trap”
schemer.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hold up your hands, quick now, Sloper!”
was what he told the other; and if he had taken
a page from the life of a cowboy Ned could not
have put his demand in plainer language, for
this was the customary salutation of one puncher
meeting another whom he had cause to believe
had evil designs on his life.</p>

<p class='c008' >The man hesitated at first. He looked on the
scouts as tenderfeet, and it galled him terribly
to have to submit to being ordered around by a
mere boy. But there was something about Ned’s
way of speaking, not to mention the businesslike
air of his frowning rifle, that warned him it
would be a pretty risky thing to defy the scout
master.</p>

<p class='c008' >Besides, there were three more fellows in
khaki close behind Ned, doubtless with other
guns that could be brought to bear on him like a
flash, if so be he ventured to disobey. And
treacherous scoundrel though he might be, Ally
Sloper valued his miserable life.</p>

<p class='c008' >So he dropped the bird and elevated both
hands above his head, showing that he surrendered
to superior force and conditions which he
was powerless to change.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jack!” called out Ned, keeping his eyes
riveted on the man and never swerving that
threatening rifle a fraction of an inch.</p>

<p class='c008' >“On deck, Ned,” came the answer, close to
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Step out there and relieve Sloper of his gun.
Be careful not to get between us, remember. If
he’s going to be allowed to walk around till
Harry’s uncle comes back to settle his case, I
don’t think it’s wise he should go armed. Men
sometimes get mad and do things they’re sorry
for afterwards. You hear what I’m saying,
Sloper. There’s no harm going to come to you
until Colonel Job comes back; but it’s just as
well that your claws are trimmed. And if you
know what’s good for you, don’t try any kind
of slippery trick on us. I can shoot to hit, and
I will. Get that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! that’s all right,” replied the other, in an
apparently careless tone, though his face was
drawn with anger and his eyes blazed with the
venom of a panther at bay, “keep right along
with your little circus. It gives you some fun
and it don’t hurt me any. Somebody’s been
killin’ one of my birds, and that’s what I’m
huffy about.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned waited until Jack had stepped forward
and whipped the heavy revolver out of its leather
holster before he went on to say anything further.
When this had been accomplished he
proceeded to tell the man something more.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A hawk was your undoing, Sloper. It
pounced on your bird and was going to make a
meal of it, when one of my chums used his gun
to knock the pirate over. Then we found a
little note fastened to the bird’s leg. I have
that note here, and mean to give it to the Colonel
when he gets back. I won’t say what it contains;
there’s no need of it with you. But we expect
that Colonel Haines will have little trouble in
fastening the guilt on the right party, after he
sees the handwriting and compares it with that
of the punchers working for him. And then it’ll
be good-bye for some one.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” declared Jimmy, hotly, determined to
have his say in the matter, “and the same feller
ought to thank his lucky stars if he gets away
from here without being treated to a rope necklace,
or given a coat of tar and feathers. I’ve
heard that men have been up against that sort
of medicine out here for less things than tryin’
to turn the herds of their employers over to the
cattle rustlers.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The puncher looked at Jimmy, and his upper
lip drew back with what was more like a snarl
than anything else.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You got to prove a thing first,” he snapped.
“It’s easy to say that a man’s gone bad, but my
word’s as good as the next one. Wait and see
what the Kunnel thinks. You’re all down on
me, I know, but you don’t see me shakin’ in my
boots, do ye? Somebody hooked one of my
birds, I’m asayin’, and used it to send a message
with. That’s all there is to the thing. It ain’t
agoin’ to bother me any, I’m atellin’ ye.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! Chunky told us you’d give us that sort
of a yarn,” Jimmy declared, “but it don’t go
down one little bit. We’re on to your curves,
Mr. Sloper, let me tell you. You’ll sing small
when the Colonel comes home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Rats! Nobody’ll be gladder to meet him
than me!” asserted the other, with a great showing
of effrontery that Ned knew was only
assumed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned felt that the chances were anything he
said in trying to show the man what an offense
he had been guilty of in betraying his employer
would be wasted; but he could not resist the
temptation to tell him something about scout
law, and how boys are being taught in these
days to be faithful to their trust above all things.
What he took it upon himself to say, in the most
pleasant way he could, may have glanced off
the other’s thick hide, just as water does from a
duck’s back. Still, there could be no telling;
and at some future time possibly some of the
plain truths spoken by the scout master on that
occasion were liable to rise up in the mind of
Ally Sloper to haunt him.</p>

<p class='c008' >He did not make any reply when Ned finished,
only to scowl and remark:</p>

<p class='c008' >“S’posen I c’n trot along now, without anybody
borin’ me in the back?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“As if a scout would ever be guilty of shooting
anybody in the back!” Jimmy indignantly burst
out with.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, go about your business, Sloper,” Ned
told him, “and if I was you I’d have as little to
do with the boys as possible the balance of the
day. They’re talking some about you, and it
might be your wisest policy not to wander away
to any lonely place, because I wouldn’t put it
past them to take things into their hands before
the Colonel comes back.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The look that appeared on the puncher’s face
was as black as a thundercloud. Instinctively
he clapped his hand at his side and then gritted
his teeth when it only came in contact with an
empty holster. A cowboy without his ready gun
is somewhat of a helpless individual, from the
fact that he has come to depend wholly on it in
times of trouble.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If I was heeled I wouldn’t ask favors o’ any
man,” he grumbled, “and as it is I reckons I’ll
have to cave and fight shy of the crowd. The
lot’s set agin me anyhow, and I’ll have to change
my berth, no matter what the Kunnel says.”</p>

<p class='c008' >With that he turned on his heel and strode
away. Jimmy looked after him, and then drew
a long breath.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh! talk to me about nerve,” he exploded,
“that dub has got them all beat half a mile, and
then some. But say, d’ye really think he’ll
hang around till the Colonel comes home?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Chances are he’ll beat it before the afternoon
gets old,” Jack asserted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ought we to let him sneak away, Ned?”
asked Harry. “Why not lock him up somehow,
and keep him from skipping out?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, in the first place, it isn’t our business
to play keeper to Sloper,” the scout master
replied. “There are plenty of fellows here to
attend to his case and I feel that I’ve done my
whole duty when I warned him not to try and
leave the ranch until your uncle gets home,
Harry. If Chunky and Skinny and the rest
think his room would be better than his company
or take a notion to give him a warm coat of tar
and feathers, it’s none of our affair.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I can see you sitting around and doing
nothing while such a nasty job is on,” Jack
remarked, with a shake of his head. “I know
you too well for that, Ned. If you saw them
taking Sloper out and carrying a bag and a kettle
along, I’m justly certain you’d call a halt on the
operation and stand between the skunk and the
boys who wanted to give him what he deserved.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned made no reply to this accusation. Perhaps
he knew there was considerable of truth
back of it, and that, if such a case did come about,
he would be strongly tempted to try and restrain
the angry and indignant punchers.</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys loitered around all morning. No one
seemed able to do any particular work, save
look after the cattle in the stockade, carrying
water and seeing that they had some hay to keep
them quiet. When the two stockmen returned
from the station they would have to decide
whether it were safe to drive the herds to the
feeding grounds again, and watch them for a
while, so as to guard against further trouble.</p>

<p class='c008' >So noon came and went. Jimmy had no complaint
to make on the score of lack of food. He
told his chums he was making up for lost time;
and the grinning Chinese cook was only too well
pleased to dance attendance on the scout, whom
he seemed to fancy more than any of the others.</p>

<p class='c008' >Half of the afternoon dragged away, and it
was understood that possibly in two more hours
they could expect the absent owners of the ranch
to show up, unless detained by something not
down on the bills.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a very hot afternoon, and as they had
not been oversleeping of late, the four scout
chums found themselves nodding as they sat on
the shady side of the verandah. Jimmy had
crawled into the one hammock and refused to
budge. He declared that his sleep had been so
wretched lately that he had a whole lot to make
up.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now and then one of them would arouse
enough to ask some drowsy question, after which
they would relapse into silence once more.</p>

<p class='c008' >This sleepy condition of things was suddenly
disturbed by loud shouts, and what seemed to
be a rushing about on the part of excited cow
punchers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even Jimmy raised his fiery head from the
hammock to call out:</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the bloomin’ row about now? Is
that the way they always act when the Colonel
shows up in the distance? Well, I ain’t agoin’
to climb out of this snug hammock to go gallopin’
over the hot plain just to yell and swing
my hat. You’ll have to excuse me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I don’t believe it’s the Colonel coming
at all!” declared Jack. “Look at the way the
boys are jumping for their horses, will you?
And there’s some snatching up belts with guns,
and ropes as well. It’s something else that’s
happened.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wouldn’t be much surprised if that Sloper’s
nerve had begun to fail him as the time drew
near for my uncle to come back, and that he’s
skipped out, taking chances of being overhauled
and strung up, rather than to face Colonel Job.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whoop! you’re right, Harry, for there he goes
lickety-split right now!” cried Jimmy, eagerly
pointing with an extended hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >Looking in that direction they could all see a
solitary figure on horseback, speeding over the
sun-kissed plain with all the haste possible. It
was undoubtedly Ally Sloper, who had finally
reached the conclusion that as he would be
kicked off the place anyway after his employer
had been convinced of his guilt, perhaps he had
better not wait upon the order of his going but
take a hasty departure.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was spurring his pony “for keeps” as
Jimmy observed. Shortly afterwards a bunch
of the punchers broke away from the saddle
corral and went swiftly in the wake of the fleeing
reprobate.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look at him wavin’ his hat at the crowd!”
exclaimed Jimmy. “Sure I’d hate to be in his
boots right now. There must be some hosses
just as good in that bunch, and look at ’em ride,
will you? I kind of think Ally will be sorry for
showin’ such a lot of hurry to clear out. He
must a got cold feet athinkin’ of facin’ his boss.
He’s made a big mistake, I’m tellin’ you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned said nothing, but he had read the treacherous
puncher as a shrewd rascal, and had an
idea Ally Sloper must know what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He gave ’em a good run for their money,
boys,” Jimmy loudly declared, “just look how
tired their poor old ponies seem to be, aholdin’
their heads hangin’ low, like they’d covered
forty miles. But I don’t see our friend, Ally,
among them. And I guess now he must have
got his medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wait and ask Skinny there, who’s heading
the lot,” Jack advised him; for he noticed the
little smile on Ned’s face and believed the scout
master was not so positive as Jimmy seemed to
be regarding the outcome of the mad race.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skinny looked gloomy and, indeed, there were
few smiles among the seven who had so gleefully
started out in his company to overhaul the fugitive
and give him a little token of their warm
regard.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you overtake him, Skinny?” Harry
called out as the returning band trotted past,
their ponies lagging fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not so’s you could notice the same, sir,”
replied the stout puncher who answered to so
misleading a name.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then his broncho was better than any of
your mounts, I suppose?” Harry continued.</p>

<p class='c008' >The cow punchers started grumbling at a
great rate, and said some pretty ugly things
about the absent one.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seems like he was too slick for us, sir,”
Skinny went on to say, dejectedly. “Co’se we
might a cort up with Ally if things’d a been
right and proper; but say, it wasn’t long before
he started to run away from the hull outfit, and
we reckons as how the old fox he must a doped
all the ponies but his own mount!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />MORE TROUBLE AHEAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >It turned out that what the dejected Skinny
had said was the truth. Even the ponies that
had not taken part in the chase of Ally Sloper
were found to be showing plain signs of being
sick. There could be no doubt but what the
sly fox had laid his plans carefully, and also
found an opportunity to carry the same out. He
must have managed to give each broncho something
in his feed that would within a certain
time weaken him, especially if subjected to any
violent exercise calculated to start the animal
sweating freely.</p>

<p class='c008' >Those who had pursued the fleeing puncher
had kept their own for a short time, and then
noticed that no matter how they urged their
mounts on they were being slowly distanced.
The extravagant gestures of derision on the part
of Sloper also aroused suspicion; and when their
ponies began to show unmistakable signs of
playing out, what seemed to be the truth dawned
upon them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It was a mighty clever ruse, I’m thinking,”
Jack remarked, as he and his chums went out
to see the sick ponies.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Are they poisoned and will they all die?”
Harry asked one of the punchers, with keen
regret in his voice, as he watched the actions of
the sick animals.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! we reckons it ain’t so bad as that there,”
replied the cowboy, “they been locoed with
some weed that Ally, he must a carried around
with him, meanin’ to use the same when the
right time came along. But Miss Haines she
give us some stuff outen the Kunnel’s medicine
chest, ’case, yuh see, he’s somethin’ o’ a vetranary
surgeon; and they seem to be pickin’
up a bit a’ready.”</p>

<p class='c008' >An hour later the expected party was discovered
heading for the ranch buildings, but not a
solitary puncher went circling out to meet them.
This fact must have given rise to considerable
wonder on the part of the two stockmen, who
knew the ways of cow punchers so well. Their
astonishment was unbounded when they arrived
at the stockade and saw the herds penned up.</p>

<p class='c008' >First of all, they greeted the scouts warmly.
As Harry was the representative of his father,
whom the stockmen hoped to induce to join
them in putting more money into their enterprise,
so as to enlarge the scope of their business,
it was only natural that he should be shown the
utmost consideration, in order that a favorable
report be taken back when he returned home.</p>

<p class='c008' >But then Harry was the nephew of both stockmen,
so to speak, and they would have welcomed
him warmly for that fact alone.</p>

<p class='c008' >When they heard all that had happened and
how the lucky finding of the dead homing
pigeon with its telltale message had betrayed
the plans of the conspirators, they could
hardly express their feelings toward the scouts.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course there followed the hasty moonlight
ride out on the range, the round-up of the
cattle that was not ordered, the fight with the
rustlers, and last, but not least, the clever way
in which Ally Sloper had made his escape so as
to avoid facing his late employers.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was soon decided to keep the herds confined
until the following morning, when they would
be driven forth once more to their several grazing
grounds. They must be guarded day and night
for the time being, and orders were given to all
hands to shoot straight in case another raid
were attempted.</p>

<p class='c008' >Colonel Haines was very angry over the way
things were going. He feared that if those reckless
rustlers were allowed to hold forth in the
strip of land bordering the Colorado, they would
continue to take toll from the herds of the Double
Cross Ranch, and that this might in some
way serve to make Harry carry an unfavorable
report back to his rich father.</p>

<p class='c008' >And so the stockmen put their heads together
and decided that the time had come to make a
determined effort to rid the country of the lawless
cattle thieves. In the morning they would send
a messenger to the nearest town with a note to
the sheriff, demanding that he come straightway
out with an armed posse and begin a systematic
search for the hiding place of the gang. It must
be war to the knife after this between the cow-punchers
and the rustlers, who must be made to
realize that it would be too hot for them in that
“neck of the woods.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In the morning everyone was up before sunrise,
for there was plenty to be attended to on
this day. The four scouts determined to ride
out in a bunch with Chunky and see the prize
herd taken back to the vicinity of Washout
Coulie. Then they could employ the
balance of the day to suit themselves, perhaps
in looking for game that was to be found in
the hills near by.</p>

<p class='c008' >The ponies had all recovered from their sickness.
Whatever it had been that the treacherous
puncher had dosed them with, either the effect
had worn off or else the horse medicine which
Mrs. Haines had taken from her husband’s
chest must have counteracted the drug. No
one was more pleased to learn this fact than
Harry, who had a very tender heart and disliked
to see even animals suffer.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy enjoyed that morning ride greatly. He
soon caught the spirit of the range, and mounted
on the back of his calico pony he drove this way
and that, shouting louder than any seasoned
puncher, slapping his quirt and doing bravely in
assisting to keep the cattle bunched on the drive.</p>

<p class='c008' >Everything seemed to be quiet around the
coulie that had been the scene of their spirited
engagement with the rustler gang some thirty
hours and more previously.</p>

<p class='c008' >After the severe lesson that had been taught
the thieving pack, it was firmly believed they
would remain in hiding for some time now, waiting
for the excitement to blow over and the
punchers to get careless again.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the same time, when the scouts started to
leave the coulie, bent on skirmishing around to
see if they could scare up anything worth while
in the shape of game, Chunky thought it his
duty to warn them to keep their eyes about
them all the while.</p>

<p class='c008' >“They’re a slick article, boys,” he remarked,
seriously, for he had already come to like the
chums exceedingly, while the feeling of interest
was just as warm on their part; “and since they
know by now from Ally that ’twas you as spoiled
their plans, they might have it in for you. If so
be you run up against any strange punchers,
don’t have anything to do with the same. They
might be rustlers, ’case you know all these here
cattle thieves has been on ranches, some time ’r
other, and got fired because they didn’t play fair.
Keep your eyes peeled all the time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what all scouts mean to do, Chunky,”
advised Jimmy, promptly. “Their motto is
‘be prepared,’ even if they don’t always live up
to the same. But we’ll try to keep our eyes on
the watch for signs of trouble. See you later,
boys! So-long!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy was rapidly picking up range ways.
All he needed to make him a regular puncher,
he imagined, was a cowboy suit with sheepskin
chaps and a real range hat, to take the place of
the campaign headgear that as a scout he always
wore.</p>

<p class='c008' >Already the calico pony was showing signs of
being conquered. Jimmy had a masterful way
about him, being a bit reckless, and the animal,
no doubt, began to understand that, as his new
rider seemed bent on keeping up the fight to the
bitter end, it might be the best policy to seem
to yield. But Ned, still having in mind the
white eyes that struck him as treacherous,
warned Jimmy not to trust his mount too far.</p>

<p class='c008' >They rode for miles along the foot of the hills.
Ned never failed to keep track of the distance
and the points of the compass. When they considered
that it was time to head toward home
they could depend on the scout master to tell them
just where the ranch buildings lay, and about
how much distance separated them from home.</p>

<p class='c008' >Up to that time they had not come across any
signs of game, a fact that caused Jimmy to express
himself as very much disappointed; for
their lunch had been a scanty one, according to
his mind, and he indulged in high hopes that if
they could only knock over an antelope or a
deer while the rest were resting, he could start
a cooking fire and fix up a little snack to allow
him to hold out until suppertime arrived.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned, who had been closely observing their
surroundings for some little time now, gave it
as his opinion that they might find something in
the shape of quarry if they left the plain and
turned into the scrub that covered the slope of
the hills.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It looks like our last chance for to-day, boys,”
he announced, “and because our chum, Jimmy
here, has set his heart so much on taking home
some game, we might make one more try. If
nothing shows up in half an hour we’ll call the
hunt off for to-day and come again some other
time. Are you all agreeable?”</p>

<p class='c008' >There was no dissenting voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >Half an hour may have seemed like a very
short time to Jimmy, who disliked to give anything
up on which he had set his heart; but he
realized that Ned was always a better judge of
things than he could ever hope to be. Besides,
their ponies had begun to exhibit slight signs of
weariness, not having fully recovered from the
effects of the weed they had eaten, and which
had made them sick. As the ranch buildings
were a good many miles away, they must not
force the ponies too hard if they hoped to be
home by sunset.</p>

<p class='c008' >This was only the first of many trips the scouts
had planned to cover during their stay at the
cattle ranch. They meant to exhaust the resources
of the country for good times, and Jack
was figuring on adding largely to his collection
of wild animals’ pictures while there. He had
interested Jimmy in the matter, so that he could
count on company and assistance in his excursions
by day and night in search of fitting subjects.</p>

<p class='c008' >They turned their ponies at the brush and
started to comb it, being constantly on the watch
for signs of a leaping deer aroused from a noonday
nap in the shade.</p>

<p class='c008' >The going was inclined to be rough, so that
they had to be careful not to let their mounts
trip and throw them.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned knew that what little air there was stirring
came in their faces, which was a favorable
sign; but it is doubtful whether any of the others
noticed this fact, as they were not in the same
class as the scout master when it came to understanding
the elements that go to make a successful
stalk.</p>

<p class='c008' >Still no game obliged them by jumping out of
some shady covert, which Jimmy considered
mighty mean, when his stomach was fairly clamoring
for food. When the nature of their surroundings
showed a considerable change, and
instead of mere brush and a scraggy growth of
trees they found rocks surrounding them, with
miniature canyons opening up all around, Ned
began to think they had gone far enough.</p>

<p class='c008' >He yielded, however, to Jimmy’s pleading when
the latter suggested that they fasten the ponies in
a thicket and advance a short distance on foot.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It looks good to me up yonder,” Jimmy was
saying feverishly. “I’m most sure now I glimpsed
somethin’ movin’, which might have been a
browsin’ Rocky Mountain big horn sheep, if
they have such down here; or, again p’raps, it
was a grizzly bear, or a four-legged venison
feedin’. Let’s take a turn up there and if we
don’t raise a solitary thing, why, I’ll give in and
go back home empty-handed, feelin’ like a dog
with his tail between his legs.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned certainly would not think of letting Jimmy
make that little excursion alone, nor did he
feel like allowing only one other to accompany
the would-be mighty hunter. Chunky had
warned them particularly against getting scattered
while exploring the country roundabout.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where one goes all must follow!” he said,
positively.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bully for you, Ned,” Jimmy declared joyously.
“The more the merrier they say; and Jack
and me’ll be glad to have the whole bunch along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How about the ponies, Ned; do you think
it is safe to leave them here?” Harry wanted
to know, a little anxious about the safety of
their mounts; because a twelve-mile hike did
not appeal to him just then.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t think anything or anybody would
be apt to bother them,” Jack remarked, although
no one had asked his opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure they won’t,” asserted the eager Jimmy,
making his jaws work as though in imagination
he were already enjoying a tender venison steak
alongside of a splendid camp fire.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll have to risk a little,” Ned admitted, as
he dismounted, and once more looked to see
that his rifle was in condition for immediate use.</p>

<p class='c008' >They found places where the ponies could be
tied, and the animals evidently did not object to
the rest in the least, if their actions were any judge.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Tis meself that’s thinkin’ the dope Ally
Sloper gave Spot here, as I’ve renamed Satan,
must have taken the heart out of the critter,
because he’s been as gentle as you please all day,”
Jimmy remarked, as he patted the calico pony;
but Ned only shook his head without making
any reply, for he had seen the ears flattened
and noted the half-inclination on the part of the
pony to bite at the hand that was caressing its
wet neck and withers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Presently they started up the canyon toward
the spot where Jimmy still declared he believed
he had seen an object move, which must be
game of some sort. All conversation having
been positively tabooed by Ned, Jimmy could
only take it out in sundry grins and vigorous
nods of his head as they proceeded.</p>

<p class='c008' >Everybody was tuned up to a tense state of
excitement as they reached the bend of the rock
wall and then carefully crept around the same.
Unless Jimmy had made a mistake, or was willfully
deceiving them, they must speedily discover
the animal he claimed to have sighted.
All sorts of speculations were doubtless rife in
their minds concerning its nature; one hoped it
would prove to be a deer; another may have had
a monster grizzly in view while caressing his
repeating rifle; while Jack, who carried his little
camera along with him, would have been highly
pleased could he have snapped off a big-horn
sheep in the act of leaping from crag to crag
somewhere up there along the high canyon walls.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nothing loomed up, though Ned went further
than his prudence dictated, in order to
satisfy Jimmy. The latter’s face had fallen
forty-five degrees, and he was shaking his head
gloomily as he stared around, looking in vain for
favorable signs.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was even about to open his mouth and
give the order that would take the little party
back to where they had left their mounts tied,
when he heard something like a stone falling
back of him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Remembering that the canyon had narrowed
there, like the neck of a bottle, Ned turned
suddenly on his heels. If he expected to discover
any sort of wild game slinking off, he was
greatly in error. What he did see caused a spasm
of alarm to dart through the scout master’s
brave heart.</p>

<p class='c008' >Up on a shelf of rock, just over the narrow part
of the defile, several figures of men could be seen.
They looked like ordinary cowboys, but when
Ned recognized Ally Sloper and Coyote Smith,
yes, and Lefty Louie as well among them, he
understood that instead they were a part of the
rustler gang that he and his chums had been
instrumental in cheating out of their intended
prey!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />AT BAY IN THE CANYON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Dodge back!” suddenly snapped Ned, as he
seized hold of Jimmy and half-pulled him along;
while Harry and Jack, although they did not
understand what it was all about, made haste
to tumble pellmell in the direction the scout master
was dragging the fourth chum.</p>

<p class='c008' >A gun cracked and chips of stone flew up very
close to their feet. This was quite enough to
tell the others what sort of danger menaced
them. It doubtless acted as a spur to hasten
their departure from the open, for in another
moment they were to be seen huddled under a
shelf of rock, each fellow eagerly handling his
rifle as though ready to give a good account of
himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Was it just one man made us skip out like
all that?” Jimmy wanted to know, for he was
proud, and the thought would have come back
to him many times later on, to cause heartburnings
and keen regrets.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, there was a bunch of them there,” Ned
informed them. “I recognized Ally Sloper, Coyote
Smith and Lefty Louie. There was another
big man along, a regular giant, with a bushy head
of hair and the look of a terror!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wow! I wonder now if that wasn’t Amos’s
awful dad?” Jimmy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But what are we going to do about it, Ned?”
Harry wanted to know. “Here we are, caught
in a little rat-trap, seems like. If we start to
run out of this canyon, how do we know what
they’ll do? They’ve shot once already and, perhaps,
stand ready to give us a volley. This is a
bad job, seems to me. See what your everlasting
teasing of Ned gets us into, Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, we ain’t all dead yet, are we?” the
other naively wanted to know, “and our guns
ought to shoot just as straight as the ones they
handle, which I reckon now are only the kind
punchers carry, and no good at a distance.
Chirk up, Harry, and listen to what Ned’s goin’
to say.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Instead of speaking Ned crept cautiously forward
a little ways, and when he returned again,
reported that so far as he could see the men on
the ledge had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But that’s not saying they’re gone, is it?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m afraid not,” replied the scout master.
“You see, they command the passage from
up there on that ledge. If we try and go out,
they can drop rocks down and give us a volley
from their guns, while we wouldn’t be able to
sight them.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Two might stay here and keep the ledge
covered while the others went out,” suggested
Harry, “and play the game that way. With our
rifles we’d make things so warm for the bunch
they’d hardly dare show themselves. And after
the first two got out, why, they could hold the
fort for the others. How’s that, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not bad,” replied the one addressed, “only
I’m afraid there may be others near by. I heard
some one shout just then, which I take it must
be a signal. There goes another yell from across
the canyon.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“By jinks! I believe we’re surrounded!” ejaculated
Jimmy, and strange as it might seem, there
was something not unlike a vein of gratification
in his voice, as though the boy really felt
pleased to know they were in for another spell
of action.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’re going to have a fight, that’s certain!”
announced Jack, handling his weapon with nervous
fingers, in sharp contrast to Ned’s steady
ways.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, this ought to make a pretty fair sort
of a fort, I should think,” Harry remarked, as
he indicated the slanting rock under which they
had crawled, and which sheltered them fairly
well from any peril that might be hovering above.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But if they once get up above us in the canyon,
and below as well, they could pour in what
is called an enfilading fire, and make it mighty
unpleasant under our rock mushroom fort,”
Jack explained.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Which will be apt to happen, sooner or later,
if they mean to give us trouble,” assented Ned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then we’d better get a hustle on and see if
we c’n side-step any,” Jimmy was heard to
remark.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Keep watching, up and down, and shoot at
any moving thing you glimpse,” Ned told them,
as he started to creep further under the shelf.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where are you going, Ned?” Harry asked,
filled with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“To see what chance there is of our finding a
safer refuge than this,” replied the scout master.
“Somehow, I seem to have a notion that there’s
a sort of crevice in the canyon wall close by. If
it turns out that way and it’s big enough for us
to crawl in, why, we’ll be better fixed to stand
that crowd off.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good luck to you!” Jimmy called after him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t watch what I’m doing, but keep guard
in front!” were the last words Ned sent back
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008' >A minute later and Jack announced that he
believed there was some one moving up amidst
some scraggy bushes growing in a spot where
earth had fallen down into the rocky cut.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve got half a mind to send a shot up there
and rout him out,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Cut her loose then,” Jimmy told him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If it doesn’t do anything else,” Harry observed,
“you’ll publish plain warning of our
intention to fight back and give as good as we
take. When they hear the crack of a rifle, perhaps,
they’ll make up their minds they don’t
want to bother us as much as they thought they
did in the start.”</p>

<p class='c008' >So Jack pressed the trigger of his weapon,
which promptly went off with a roar, owing to
the fact that at the time he was crouching in a
confined space under the shelf of rock.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look at that, would you?” cried Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >A man had jumped into momentary view, in
the midst of the leafless bushes, and making a
wild spring, vanished back of a neighboring spur
of rock.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He thought it was too hot out in the open,”
said Harry. “I wonder if you winged him with
that shot, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’d like to believe I did,” came the answer,
as Jack worked the mechanism of his rifle, so as
to send out the useless brass shell, and shoot
another cartridge from the magazine into the
firing chamber; “but from the way he jumped, in
didn’t look much like he’d been struck. Don’t
forget to watch the other side, too. If they get
started coming in on us, we’d be in a peck of
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He had hardly spoken when a gun sounded,
and they heard the splash of the bullet mushrooming
against the stone close by.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wow! that’s getting pretty close, let me tell
you!” cried Jimmy, stooping to pick up the
rough-edged, flattened circle of lead, and then
immediately dropping it with a cry: “Say,
that’s as hot as anything! It burned my fingers
to beat the band. And there goes another shot
down the canyon. They’re meanin’ business
this time, boys! If one of us gets in line with a
bullet, his name will be Dennis.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In the temporary absence of the scout master
Jack thought that the duty of looking after
their safety devolved on him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here, creep back more, everybody!” he
ordered, “and snuggled down the best you can
behind any stones you find. Make yourself as
small as anything, while that lead’s singing
around here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wish I could find a chance to bang away
back at the nervy crowd,” grumbled Jimmy, as
he sprawled out like a huge frog and listened to
several shots from as many different quarters.
“What’s sauce for the goose ought to be sauce
for the gander, too. It’s a poor rule, I always
heard, that don’t work both ways.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Try as hard as he would, however, Jimmy
seemed unable to find a chance to discharge his
gun with anything like a prospect of results.
The bullets continued to flit around them, making
all sorts of queer and blood chilling noises.
There were several narrow escapes, too; and
once Harry actually felt a tug at his arm that,
upon investigation, showed him a slit in the
khaki material of which the sleeve of his coat
was made, proving that a passing bullet had
almost drawn blood.</p>

<p class='c008' >Several minutes had passed since this bombardment
commenced, and it showed no signs of
slackening. If it continued much longer there
was a chance that one of the scouts might stop
a bullet, and the prospect did not seem very
pleasant, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c008' >While this was going on, and all hands were
grumbling, because they found so little use for
their trusty rifles, Jack heard some one gently
calling his name.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hello! is that you, Ned?” he asked joyfully,
for he felt sure that the return of the scout
master would mean a new rift in the clouds.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, tell the other boys to back in here after
you!” the other scout went on to say.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, it’s here, but hurry and get started!”
Ned continued, from the darker depths beyond.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, when the others heard that there
was an opportunity to creep out of the fire zone
they lost no time in making a move. Jimmy
was declaring at the same time that it certainly
gave him a pain to be compelled to “take water”
in that way, and without having inflicted any
material damage that they knew of on the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If we’d only knocked half a dozen of the
skunks off their pins, it wouldn’t be so bad,” he
lamented; “but I ain’t had any chance. It ain’t
fair, that’s what; and me just crazy to try my
Marlin on that lot of mutts. But wait, that’s
all; my time’s agoin’ to come yet, and then,
look out, that’s what!”</p>

<p class='c008' >When they had backed some ten feet or more
they came to the wall of the canyon. Ned was
waiting to show them where he had found a
fissure into which he must undoubtedly have
crawled some little ways, seeking to find out what
sort of a haven of refuge it would turn out to be.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I struck a match,” he told his comrades, as
they pushed into the split in the wall, “and as
near as I could make out, there’s a little cave
right here. We’ll take possession and hold the
fort against a hundred enemies.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hurrah! that’s right, we will!” shrilled the
irrepressible Jimmy, always quick to seize upon
any excuse for giving tongue.</p>

<p class='c008' >Already they seemed to have passed beyond
the reach of the flying bullets, although, of
course, the ambitious rustlers did not know that
and were still banging away right merrily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If only they’d keep that up until they’d
fired away every scrap of their ammunition,
wouldn’t it be just fine,” Harry suggested, “then
we could go out and do a little holding-up on our
own hook.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned lighted another match, so that all of
them might see what manner of refuge had been
found in this emergency. It turned out to be a
fair-sized cavity, nothing unusual, but capable
of answering their needs.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was, of course, no way of blocking the
entrance, but with four guns to stand guard there
did not seem to be much reason to fear that the
enemy could ever rush their fortress.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But it makes me clear mad to think that
while we’re cooped up here, like rats in a trap,
that crowd can hunt around for our ponies and
get away with the lot,” Jack complained.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that Jimmy raised a row.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And that’d be the last I’d see of my calico
broncho, just when I was growing attached to
him, too!” he bleated.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But from what you told us,” Jack remarked,
bitingly, “there was a time when you had to
throw your arms around his neck in order to
become <i>attached</i> to him. But never mind, Jimmy,
the rustler that gets your Spot will be sorry for
it, if I’m any judge of tricky horses. It may be
the best thing that ever happened to you. Some
times blessings come in disguise; and, if the
pony’s stolen, it may save you from getting a
broken collarbone.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The shooting presently ceased. Whether the
rustlers considered that they had accomplished
the end they had in view and utterly demoralized
the enemy; or, discovered the change of base on
the part of the four scouts, no one was able to
more than guess.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seems to me I can hear somebody talking
close by,” Jack remarked, when some time had
passed without any renewal of the bombardment.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get ready to repel boarders, then!” urged
Harry, “for they must have discovered where
we’ve crawled. Do you think they’ll try to carry
the fort by assault, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t believe so, if they’re the kind of men
I take them to be,” replied the scout master.
“It would take more than a dozen desperate
men to get in here past the hot fire we’d start
playing on them, and I reckon there isn’t that
many in the bunch. No, if they do anything at
all, look out for some trick.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But they can’t drop down on us, because
there’s only one entrance and we’ve got that
covered,” Jack asserted. “It’s dark enough in
here, but we could see if anybody came against
that line of light, and pepper him in a jiffy. I
don’t see what way they could fool us, Ned.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I hope I’m mistaken, that’s all,” the other
returned, but his vigilance did not relax a particle,
nor was he at all sanguine as to the rustlers
going away and leaving them to make their
escape as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c008' >The minutes dragged along. Every little while
Jimmy would declare that he caught those low
voices again, or it might be a rustling sound that
puzzled him. Some of the other scouts admitted
that they heard something of the same sort,
though unable to explain what it might mean.</p>

<p class='c008' >These things kept them constantly on the
alert. Their nerves were held up at a high tension
all the while they crouched there, keeping
continual watch and ward.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy had several times grumbled that it
seemed like a shame, that four able-bodied scouts
should be bottled up in this silly way, and begged
Ned to think up a plan that would change the
situation around, giving them a chance to play
the aggressor.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was about starting in for the third time to
vent his disgust, when the others heard him
begin to sniff.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the matter, Jimmy; think you smell
dinner cooking?” jeered Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, I don’t, more’s the pity; but I did get
a whiff of the most disagreeable smoke that ever
was, or could be. There she comes again, with
the breeze sendin’ the same right into this little
snuggery, hot-footed. Oh! my, don’t that take
the cake, though? Whatever can they be
burnin’ and how does it happen to get in here?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s the trick I told you they’d be playing on
us, Jimmy,” said Ned, seriously. “That’s what
they call the stink weed, and the smoke’ll drive
us out of here yet.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />SMOKED OUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >What Ned had said appalled them all. The
situation had seemed peculiar and distressing
before, because they could not see far enough
ahead to even guess how it might turn out; it
became positively terrifying now.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had heard some of the punchers speak
about the powerful agency of the weed mentioned
by the scout master. One man had told
how it was often used to force wolves from their
rocky dens. When set to smouldering, it produced
a smoke that was quite irresistible, and
which overpowered man or beast.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why can’t we find a way to keep it out of
the cave?” Jack presently demanded, when they
found themselves rubbing their eyes, in spite of
themselves, and beginning to feel half choked
in the bargain.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The opening is too wide to think of closing
it, more’s the pity,” Harry answered, with deep
regret in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And even then we couldn’t keep the smoke
out,” Ned told them; “because we’d have to
get air, and where that can enter the smoke could
too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“This is sure the worst deal I ever struck!”
gasped Jimmy. “It takes your breath away
like fun, and makes you think your eyes are
bored in your head. They call it by the right
name, I tell you, for it certainly does smell rank.
Whew! somebody fan me, or I’ll go under.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nobody took the trouble to oblige Jimmy.
The fact was they all felt it just as badly as the
freckled-faced scout; and each fellow was trying
the best he knew how to get temporary relief.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How’s it going to end, Ned?” asked Jack,
and his voice sounded very queer, for he was
talking between his teeth, not wishing to open
his mouth wider than he could possibly help.</p>

<p class='c008' >“One of two ways,” returned the scout master,
gloomily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean we’ll just have to hoist the white
rag and give up?” continued Jack, in deep disgust.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Either that or be overcome here; and nobody
wants to let that happen, because some of us
might suffocate. Anything would be better than
that, it strikes me,” was what the leader told
Jack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What if we rushed out and started to fight
our way through?” suggested Harry, who had
been listening to what his comrades said; and
the surprise of it all was that he, the peace-loving
member of the little band, should so suddenly
display such ferocity; but then it could be
laid to the terrible fumes that were driving them
all nearly distracted.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned shook his head, though, of course, none
of them saw this, for it was next door to dark
under the protecting ledge, and particularly in the
little cave that Nature had scooped out of the
solid rock.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It would be useless,” he told them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I reckon they’re all ready to meet us
with a hot fire and some of us would go under,”
Harry admitted, sadly. “But we can’t stand
this much longer, Ned. Oh! if only there was
another opening to the cave, how fine it would
be to slip out and leave them doing their grand
smoking act.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But there isn’t, I’m sorry to say,” admitted
Ned. “I took the trouble to explore it through
and through, and there’s not the first chance to
find another crack.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Have you any plan, Ned?” pleaded Jimmy,
who was choking at a terrible rate and seemed
half-blinded already.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Only a half-way idea,” replied Ned. “Here
it is for what it’s worth. Three of us will surrender,
by walking out and shouting that we
give in. Jack must manage to hide somewhere
in here and stand for it a little while longer.
There’s just the smallest chance going that
they’ll skip him; and, if it happens, he can hang
around and help us out later.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m afraid it won’t work, Ned; because they
must have seen that there were just four in our
bunch, all told; and they’ll never be happy till
they root me out,” was the opinion Jack expressed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All the same it may be worth trying,”
Ned declared; “and even if you’re found out
we can be no worse off than if we all gave up.
This is a case that needs quick action.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then just as you say, Ned, we’ll try it,”
Jack agreed. “I’ll see if I can stand this rank
smell a little while longer. Perhaps it may seem
so bad that none of the rustlers’ll care to crawl
in and look around. You can kind of give
them to understand that one of your crowd has
keeled over earlier in the fight. There’s just
a little hope it may pan out. Now, for goodness’
sake get a move on as soon as you can.
I’ll find a place behind some loose stones to
lie down and play dead. Hope when the time
comes for me to crawl out I won’t be too weak
to move.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Each of the other scouts squeezed Jack’s
hand. He was a prime favorite in the troop,
and they disliked leaving him behind more than
they could tell; but there seemed little choice
and Jack was always so willing to sacrifice himself
for the good of others.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned took the lead.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Keep close behind me,” he told Harry and
Jimmy, as they started to crawl over to where
they knew the exit must be; for the smoke was
now getting so dense that even the faint light
was shut out.</p>

<p class='c008' >Reaching this place Ned shouted, though he
found himself so hoarse that he hardly knew
his own voice; and several times choked, as
though he was close to the border of having
a fit.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hello! hello out there! we want to surrender!
We’re choking, and can’t stand it any longer.
Don’t fire on us, and we’ll come out! Hello!
hello!”</p>

<p class='c008' >There came an answering hail, close at hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right, come along, but be sure and hold
your hands up over yer heads, or you might get
hurt! understand that, kids?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes we’re nearly all in! Here we come!”</p>

<p class='c008' >With that Ned led the way, and staggering
weakly, the three scouts groped their passage
through the haze of bitter smoke toward the
faint gleam of daylight that they could begin
to see through the pall.</p>

<p class='c008' >While they were still engulfed in this mantle
they felt their guns rudely jerked from their hands
and fierce clutches taken upon their garments.
But the relief was so great when they reached
the blessed air in the canyon, almost free from
the acrid fumes of that terrible stink weed, that
for the moment they could think of nothing else.</p>

<p class='c008' >Each of them stood there, blinking, and rubbing
their smarting eyes. Rude laughter jarred
on their nerves, and they began to observe
that a circle of lawless punchers stood around,
apparently quite amused at the sight of their
agony.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seems ter me thar was four o’ the tenderfeet
kids; how ’bout that, Ally?” one of the rustlers
observed in a voice that sounded like the grumble
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned managed to look at the speaker, and he
just seemed to know without being told that
this giant must be the “awful dad” of the lad
Amos, whom they had helped out of the quicksand.
He was indeed a striking figure, and must
inspire terror in almost any man who happened
to run counter to his will. When Hy Adams
growled his dislike for anything, plans were
apt to be hastily changed, and in a fashion
calculated to suit his whim.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was another alongside who caught
Ned’s especial attention, too. He had only
to take note of the fact that this tall party
bore a scar on his left cheek to feel confident
that this must be the rustler chief, Clem Parsons,
who had played fast and loose with the
United States Government, so that his apprehension
by the Secret Service officers was apt
to put quite a feather in the cap of the one fortunate
enough to cause his arrest.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There was four of ’em,” Ally Sloper observed,
as he pushed forward at this juncture
and faced the prisoners; and raising his voice he
turned to Ned and added: “Where’d that other
feller skip out to? Was he knocked over by
our fire? We know that he never got away,
we had the canyon blocked with a cork in the
neck of the bottle.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ve lost him, somehow,” Ned replied,
brokenly, as though deeply grieved by the
fact; “and we hope you’ll look around and find
our chum, who may be bleeding to death somewhere
in the canyon behind a rock.”</p>

<p class='c008' >His eagerness to have them search seemed to
allay any suspicion that may have started to
arise.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! we’ll give a sort of look when we’re
getting out of this hole,” the man Ned took
to be Clem Parsons observed carelessly; “but
it’s too unpleasant around these diggings right
now to stay any longer than we have to. Later
on, if we happen to think of it, we may come
back and look him up. Get a move on now,
boys, and we’ll strike for the upper camp.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Those who had hold of the three prisoners
urged them forward, and it was evident that
they meant to leave the vicinity of the recent
fight. When Ned was sure of this he allowed
himself to have a most violent fit of coughing,
and managed to mix in several significant
signals that were not unlike the howl of the
wolf in the stillness of a night on the open plain.</p>

<p class='c008' >This he knew must be heard by the suffering
scout inside the cave. It would tell Jack they
were going, and that he could immediately
make a start looking toward relief from the
overpowering fumes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned would have been better satisfied could
he have received a return sign from the devoted
chum, to assure him all was well; but of course
that was utterly out of the question. He could
only hope that dear old Jack would not by this
time have become so weak from his sufferings
as to be unable to make his crawl out to the
pure air, and then follow after them.</p>

<p class='c008' >The three scouts looked quite dejected at
first. They were so accustomed to having things
come their way that this thing of being made
prisoners galled them. Jimmy in particular
bewailed the circumstances attending their
capture. He seemed to think that it was next
door to a disgrace because they had not been
able to put up a desperate resistance, and at
least disable several of the foe before yielding
to superior force.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Tis a shame, that’s what it is,” he kept on
muttering, grimly, “to have to put up your
hands like we did without knockin’ the stuffin’
out of a few of the enemy. I’ll never be able
to look myself in the face again, sure I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! yes you will, Jimmy,” Harry assured
him; “I expect to live to see the time when
you sit beside a fire, gobbling your rasher of
bacon and fried potatoes, and telling the story
of this adventure to some of the other boys in
the troop.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now, that’s adding insult to injury!” declared
Jimmy, sadly; “when you go and
make my mouth water tellin’ about breakfast
stuff. Chances are they’ll try to starve us
while they hold the lot for ransom.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned gave him a punch in the side when he
said this.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let up on that kind of talk, Jimmy,” he
whispered sternly; “don’t put the notion in
their heads. If they once knew who Harry
was, and what he came out here to do,
they’d think up some scheme to get even with
Colonel Job. Even Ally Sloper didn’t hear
what our mission was, and thinks we’re just
on the plains to have a good time. And keep
up your spirits. Leave it to Jack; he’s our best
hope just now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They were walking by themselves at the time,
the rustlers forming a sort of cordon around
them though separated by a dozen or two feet;
and hence the scouts found an opportunity
to exchange a few remarks in whispers without
being overheard.</p>

<p class='c008' >After that Harry and Jimmy did pluck up
a little more hope. So long as Jack was free
to move around they might expect assistance,
though none of them could give more than a
vague guess what shape it might take. Jack
was to decide upon his own course. He might
think it best to follow them up, and then, after
seeing where the cattle thieves had their secret
camp, make his way back to where the ponies
had been left, mount, and head for the ranch
at top speed in order to bring a rescue party
to their relief.</p>

<p class='c008' >How they hugged that hope to their hearts
as they climbed upward after those of their
captors who were in the van. Ned was wideawake
all the while. He believed that Jack
must surely follow them, and in order to make
his task as easy as possible the scout master
was trying in every way he knew how to leave
plain indications of their having passed along
this way.</p>

<p class='c008' >All this had to be done in a fashion calculated
not to attract the attention of the rustlers.
If they realized that he was purposely turning
over stones every now and then by pretending
to stumble, they would know what this implied;
consequently the rustlers would lay a trap for
the comrade who was expected to follow;
and hence Jack, when coming creeping along
the trail, might walk into an ambush, so that
he too be taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c008' >An hour passed, and all of the scouts were
becoming very weary of climbing, much against
their will, when indications ahead told them
they must be getting close to the rustlers’ camp.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was hidden in the most isolated part of
the mountain range, and where there did not
seem to be one chance in ten that any cow
puncher would ever stray in search of lost
steers. Faint wreaths of smoke first told the
sharp-eyed Ned that the camp was near by;
then he heard a dog bark, and a horse neigh,
as well as sounds very similar to the rattle
of steers’ horns when being driven from one
pasturage to another.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ten minutes later and they were walking into
the camp. They boys observed everything
closely, for they never expected to again find
themselves in the midst of a gang of reckless
rustlers, and it was their policy to “make
hay while the sun shone.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Strange to say they had not been searched
up to now for any valuables, though the man
who was leader of the rustlers had looked to
make sure they were not armed with any
weapons besides their rifles and hunting knives,
both of which had been taken away from them.</p>

<p class='c008' >Harry wished now he had thought to ask
Jack to lend him his little camera, for the spectacle
of that camp was one they must often
wish to remember in future days. Still, as
those who dwelt in the heart of the mountains
were mostly fugitives from justice, it was hardly
likely they would permit any one to snap off
a picture that must prove of value to the
officers who were often looking for them far
and wide.</p>

<p class='c008' >The afternoon was pretty well done by now.
Had their original plans been carried out the
boys would have been entering camp by this
time. Instead they found themselves in one of
the most distressing situations in their career;
prisoners among the lawless rustlers, who must
know that much of their recent defeat was due
to the coming of these Boy Scouts to the cattle
ranch bordering the Colorado country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />IN THE HANDS OF THE RUSTLERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >As the night came on the spirits of the three
scouts seemed to sink considerably. Somehow
the passing of the sun and coming of darkness
before the rising of the moon brought with it
a new sense of being at the mercy of these
rough men, who snapped their fingers at the
law, and did about as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned at first wondered why they had been
brought here to the camp, the location of which
had long been a mystery to outsiders. He even
feared that circumstance meant something terrible
to himself and two chums, because now
that they held the secret of the hide-out of the
rustlers, it did not seem likely they would be
allowed to depart, even if they swore never to
betray the fugitives from justice.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then he noticed certain signs, being a most
observant lad, as we already know, that told
him another story. The rustlers for some reason
or other were getting ready to make a change
of base. Perhaps they believed that the vicinity
of the Double Cross Ranch was likely to become
too warm for them after what had happened, for
Ally Sloper must have brought considerable news
when he joined the gang.</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys were allowed to sit together on a
blanket. They had been tersely warned by the
hoarse-voiced giant that if they so much as
tried to escape they were sure to be shot down
like coyotes; and there was that in his ferocious
manner that made Harry shiver with apprehension;
while Jimmy was seen to clench his
fists and grit his teeth, as though his fighting
blood had been aroused.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned had to smile, though, when he looked at
the fearful difference between the two; one a
giant and the other not far from being a dwarf.
It reminded him of a little bantam defying a
great barnyard rooster, or of David, armed only
with his puny sling, facing Goliath, the mighty
man of the Philistines.</p>

<p class='c008' >Fortunately Jimmy had sense enough not to
open his mouth, thanks to the shove Ned gave
him with his elbow. Had he dared say anything
bold and saucy to the big bully, the chances were
he would have rued the day, for Hy Adams could
have easily seized him by the nape of the neck
and swung him around his head six or seven
times, just for a lark.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wonder now do we get any?” Jimmy was
saying, rather plaintively, as he sniffed the odors
of supper cooking.</p>

<p class='c008' >Jimmy could have stood for almost anything
save starvation, or being deprived of his regular
feed. If he had known that he had to run the
gauntlet in the morning, or be toasted at the
stake, the chances were that he would have let
out a howl to the effect that he hoped they
would at least fill him up with something to eat
before making him lie down for the night.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wonder where he can be right now?”
Harry was whispering, as he managed to cast
his eyes around the bordering rocks, without
doing it in such an open manner as to invite
suspicion, in case any of the rustlers were
watching them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course you mean dear old Jack,” the
scout master went on to say; “and I’m hoping
he’s at the ranch by this time, telling his story
to the Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I can shut my eyes and see the riot there’d
be in that case,” mused Harry, with a sigh;
“every puncher would be wanting to join the
rescue bunch, and the herds might go hang for
one night. But Ned, perhaps he followed us up
here?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, that might be so,” admitted the other
scout.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Meaning to try and get us loose all by himself,”
added Harry, huskily, as if the very
thought of such a thing caused him to tremble
with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It would be a great feat if Jack could manage
it,” admitted Ned, longingly, “and I’ve got a
lot of faith in our chum; but somehow I hope
he’s chosen to make for the ranch and get the
boys started this way.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Queer they didn’t bother doing much hunting
for Jack, did they?” pursued Harry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! you heard what the leader said, that
it was too smoky and unpleasant down in the
canyon, and that they’d come back in the morning
to look him up. Little do they care whether
he’s living or dead. They’re a heartless bunch;
and I’d like to see them caught in a net. You
can see they’ve got some of their women folks
along, and that this is like a regular border
village. There’s a pack of dogs, and over in that
cabin I’ve counted as many as four children—all
with hair that looks like it had never known
a comb and clothes that would shame an Indian
squaw. But the men are a tough lot, and all
they seem to care for is playing cards, drinking,
smoking and stealing cattle.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The night had settled down by now. It was
dark at first, because the moon would not rise
until a little later, being now past its full.</p>

<p class='c008' >Greatly to the relief of Jimmy one of the
women brought them over some supper, such as
it was. They were hungry enough to forget its
shortcomings, though Jimmy did complain a
little that they saw the bottom of the kettle
too soon to suit him, and that he just knew he’d
wake up feeling starved long before dawn. But
then Ned and Harry were so used to hearing
their comrade let out this sort of a wail that
they let it pass by, without extending him any
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now for a night of it!” Harry said, later on,
after they had been sitting there, watching the
strange scene until they began to feel sleepy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But how are we goin’ to sleep without our
blankets?” Jimmy wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We might ask for some,” Ned told him, “but
honest now, I’d feel a little queer about snuggling
down in some of the coverings I’ve noticed
around here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Same with me,” added Harry, shuddering,
“because I’m silly enough to be a little particular
about the blanket I get my face down in. If
they’d only let us crawl in out of the night air,
that tumbledown cabin close by would suit the
bill. Suppose you beckon to that leader fellow
and ask him, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >So when Ned managed to catch the eye of
the party he believed to be the much wanted
Clem Parsons, he invited him to come over to
where they sat, which the man did, though with
a frown on his scarred face and an ugly look in
his eye that the boys did not like any too well.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It gets pretty cool toward morning and as
we haven’t any blankets, would you mind if we
crawled inside that deserted cabin there to
sleep?” Ned asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“So you can get your heads together and try
to skip out, is that what you’re after?” the rustler
demanded, harshly. “Well, this place is as
good as anything you’ll get, so make the most
of it. Tomorrow we’re meaning to fix you up, so
as to let old Colonel Job know what we think of
him. Perhaps he’ll have a special cage built to
keep his prize fowls in when you get back to
Double Cross Ranch. We owe him a long bill,
and think we see a chance to pay it before we
quit this region for our new location down in
Arizona. Now shut up and don’t give us any
bother, or I’ll let Hy Adams loose on you. He
wanted to have a quirt jubilee right away, with
you boys tied to stakes, and every puncher
being allowed three cuts at your bare shoulders.
But I said, ‘Wait till morning for the fun.’”</p>

<p class='c008' >With that he turned on his heel and left them,
Jimmy with wide-open mouth and trembling
with indignation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“D’ye think now he meant that, or was he
playin’ hocus-pocus with us boys?” was what
Jimmy asked, as soon as he could catch his
breath.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’d like to believe it was in the nature of a
joke,” Ned told him, “and that he was only
trying to make us feel bad during the rest of the
night; but from all I’ve heard about Clem
Parsons, he’s a cold-blooded scamp, and I’m
afraid he means to do something to us, Harry,
that will make your Uncle Job furious. He said
they meant to leave this part of the country, and
on that account it’s likely they’ll go further
than if they expected to stay around here right
along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee! I’m sorry to hear that,” Harry observed,
and it could be seen that the boy must be considerably
worked up, for Harry seldom used
slang of any kind.</p>

<p class='c008' >As for Jimmy, he ground those strong white
teeth of his and muttered to himself in a fashion
that told how excited he was.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There he is talking with that big rustler
now,” Harry remarked, a minute later; “the
one you think must be Hy Adams, and who
hurried over to join the leader after he saw him
leave us. See the giant swinging his arms, and
hear him growl like thunder in the distance.
Now, what d’ye think he can be asking of Clem
Parsons, Ned? D’ye expect he wants to have
that nice little practice whipping-bee right away,
and not wait for morning to come?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know, but something’s bothering
him—that’s sure—for he keeps pointing this
way and wagging that great big head of his, like
he’d shake it off. Seems to me as though he’s
winning his point, too, because the other man
isn’t objecting as much as he did before.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, he shrugs his shoulders and turns
away, just like he told him to do as he wanted
and that as for him, he washed his hands of the
whole business. Oh! what if they do start in to
use those cruel quirts on our backs, Ned?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned Nestor turned a little white himself at
the very thought; but he clenched his teeth in
that determined way of his and said, slowly:</p>

<p class='c008' >“That would be pretty tough, boys, and I
hope it doesn’t strike us; but if it should, remember
that we’re scouts, and supposed to be able
to stand pain, like the Indians were taught,
without wincing or crying out.”</p>

<p class='c008' >All of them were watching Hy Adams with
uneasy eyes. They seemed to know from the
triumphant glare with which the terror of the
hills observed them that he must have carried
his point with the leader, and was now only
figuring on how he had better proceed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh! if only I had my Marlin here right now,
mebbe I wouldn’t put him on the blink in a
hurry, though?” Jimmy was sighing; “I’d hold
up the camp and let you fellers find your own
guns. Then we’d pick out the ones we wanted
to keep, and tell the others to clear out. But
that’s all a dream, because here I am with only
me two fists to back me up, and they wouldn’t
count against that hog!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Hy Adams was now talking with several of
the most dissipated looking of the men. Whatever
he might be telling them it seemed to please
the others immensely, for they laughed harshly;
and one fellow immediately stepped over to take
down his quirt from where it hung alongside
the door of a shack.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, did you see that?” demanded Harry,
“it means whips after all, Ned! Oh! to think of
their cruel hearts. Just like we lived down in
Delaware, where they have the whipping post
going. Can we do anything to get them to let
up on the game?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m sorry to say not,” responded Ned.
“Seems as if they’d got to the point where they
must see the blood flow to satisfy their desire
for revenge. We spoiled their little scheme for
getting your uncle’s best herd of prize cattle
that he means for exhibition purposes and this
Adams has it in for us on that account.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you ever see such a terrible brute in
your born days?” Harry asked, with a shiver of
dread, for there were three punchers now who
had laid hold of quirts and amused themselves,
cracking the lashes at the ends of the whips as
though desirous of inspiring additional fear in
the hearts of the prisoners by making such
suggestive sounds.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Amos was right when he said his step-father
was the biggest terror along the border,” Ned
admitted. “I’ve seen some bad men, but never
one that struck you as the howling storm does,
and that describes Hy Adams. I’m feeling sorry
for Amos, who must get in the way of that ham
of a fist every once in so often. And that little
woman who calls Hy Adams her husband, just
think of how she must suffer when he rages like a
bull in a china shop?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now he’s heading this way, Ned,” Harry said
half inaudibly, for he was tremendously excited.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, try your level best to show a brave
front, Harry, no matter what happens. We’ve
been in lots of tough places and, somehow, always
seem to get out before the worst we’ve been
expecting comes along. I’ll try and talk him
out of doing this cowardly thing. Sometimes
I seem to be able to swing people around to my
way of thinking, you know, Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, that’s so, Ned, you nearly always can;
but you’re up against it this time, I’m afraid.
He’s only a big brute, and chances are he’ll
strike you in the mouth if you try and talk him
out of doing a thing he wants to carry out. We
certainly are in the worst fix of our lives right
now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Talk to me about the silver linin’ of the
cloud,” burst out Jimmy, “I’d like to see what
that means. Here we’re in a black hole and the
ladder’s been took away. I’m feeling pretty
punk myself; but c’n stand it if the rest of
you do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“They always say it’s darkest just before
dawn, Jimmy,” advised Ned, seeking to buoy
up the spirits of his two chums more than that he
could himself see any reason for hope.</p>

<p class='c008' >The giant, accompanied by a crowd of men
and women, advanced toward the spot where
the three scouts stood awaiting their coming,
for the boys had scrambled to their feet, anxious
to know the worst.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Peel off!” roared the bulky leader, with some
pretty strong additions to the order that no
doubt he fancied were apt to strike terror to the
hearts of the trio of khaki-clad boys who had
fallen into their hands. “Strip them ere jackets
oft in a hurry, ’case we’s agwine tuh warm yuh
up some. Fear’d ye’d git cold in the night, was
yuh? We’ll fix it so’t you won’t need tuh worry
’bout feelin’ the chill o’ the night air. Quick
now, git bare down tuh the waist, er we’ll hev
tuh help ye strip!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned did not say a word of protest. He realized
then and there that such a thing would be on the
same principle as waving a red flag in front of an
enraged bull.</p>

<p class='c008' >He looked at Harry and Jimmy and then
began to unbutton his faded khaki coat, while
the impatient giant started to snap his quirt
viciously close to their ears, as though he could
hardly wait until the time came to use it on
their shrinking flesh.</p>

<p class='c008' >They did not dare linger too long, and yet it
was without any heart that the chums began to
disrobe. Who could blame them for their hesitation
and the beseeching looks they fastened
on the red face of the big bully of the camp.
But water falling on the rock would make as
much impression as these looks seemed to do on
Hy Adams.</p>

<p class='c008' >They were down to the last garment when
Harry uttered a little cry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look, oh, look, Ned, who’s coming into
camp!” he whispered; but Jimmy must have
also caught the words, for he immediately added:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, it’s little Amos and his poor maw;
mebbe they know the camp’s agoin’ to be busted
up and they got orders from the boss to come
here, so’s to travel along with the rest. But
shucks! Little Amos and his maw can’t help us
any. They just come in time to see the circus—that’s
all!”</p>

<p class='c008' >And yet, strange as it might seem, a tiny glow
of hope struggled up in Ned’s heart; just as
though the coming of those two helpless ones
might be the straw that was meant to swing
the balance again in their favor, he knew not
how!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />THE REAL BOSS—CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Ned saw Amos, who was leading a couple of
burros loaded with stuff apparently from the
cabin on the creek, stop and stare at them. Then
he dropped the ropes by which he was leading
the pack animals, and clutching his mother’s
dress pointed excitedly toward the spot where
the drama was being conducted.</p>

<p class='c008' >Just what he may have said Ned did not know,
but to his astonishment both Amos and his
“maw” started toward them, almost running in
their eagerness to get there.</p>

<p class='c008' >Some one among the rustlers must have seen
them coming, for Ned discovered that broad
smiles were spreading over the faces of the men
nearest him, and he wondered why this should be.</p>

<p class='c008' >He knew very soon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hy Adams was bustling around and roaring
as was his wont, because he saw the boys ceasing
their efforts to disrobe, as he had ordered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I done tole yuh what yuh’d git ’less yuh
hurried, and take that!” he shouted at the top
of his terrible voice, as he aimed a vicious cut
at the nearest scout, who happened to be Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008' >The quirt struck him squarely across his
shoulders, and as there was only a thin garment
to protect the skin, Jimmy gave utterance to an
involuntary yell, though there may have possibly
been more of anger in the outcry than distress.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then something unexpected happened. That
stinging quirt was snatched from the uplifted
hand of the bully, and, as he whirled to see who
dared interfere with his pleasure, he seemed
rooted to the spot to discover the blazing face
of a wiry little woman thrust close up to his.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s all this mean, Hy Adams, you big
hulking coward!” she shrilled in tones that could
be heard all over the camp; “here you darin’
to whip the brave boys that saved our Amos
from bein’ drawed down in a quicksand! I told
’em when they stopped in to see me that I’d do
anything I could to pay ’em back, and seems
like the time has come sooner’n we thought it
would. Jest drap them whips—all of ye! There
ain’t agoin’ to be any fun like that to-night, you
hear me, Hy Adams? Tell the pack to clear out.
Hurry up now, and do what I say, or I’ll humble
you afore the hull crowd!”</p>

<p class='c008' >There never was such a complete change in a
man as had come over the giant. In that
apparently meek little woman he knew of old
that he had his boss. Ned understood now
plainly enough what Amos meant every time
he mentioned his step-father as being such a
bully that men jumped to do his bidding; and,
on each occasion, wound up with a few mysterious
words that, at the time, had piqued his,
Ned’s, curiosity very much.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hy Adams glared at his wife for a full minute;
but if anything her snapping eyes blazed with
more fire than ever. Then he wilted, as a
starched linen collar is likely to do on a hot
summer day.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shore, it’s all right, Belinda, if yuh sez so,”
he said weakly, “we was jest agivin’ ’em a little
skeer tuh pay up fur them havin’ knocked us
out o’ a bully lot o’ prize steers. But I sure
reckons as how they been punished enough.
Turn around, boys, and let it go till mornin’,
when we’ll kerry out our plans.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not if they mean any harm acomin’ to these
boys, just put that in yer pipe and smoke it, Hy
Adams,” his wife told him, as she shook her fore
finger under his nose; then she suddenly thrust
her whole hand against his face, and continued:
“Now, make yerself skeerce, ’cause I wants to
talk with these boys. But I’ll be awatchin’ you,
Hy Adams, don’t forgit that. And I allers
keep my word, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Then Ned understood what Amos had meant
when he said there were “high old times” at
home every time this big step-father of his came
around, and that his visits were getting less
numerous.</p>

<p class='c008' >After that the boys had it easier. Mrs. Adams
even got out several blankets of her own from
the bundles on the pack animals and loaned
them to the scouts; but all of them wished she
hadn’t been so kind, for they felt that now they
must of necessity make use of the coverings, and
it hurt some.</p>

<p class='c008' >By degrees the camp quieted down. Jimmy
was long since fast asleep, but then Jimmy
could get in that condition with only half a
chance. Harry had remained wakeful quite a
while, but Ned believed he, too, must have
crossed over, for at times he was able to catch
the regular breathing of his chum that seemed
to tell of slumber and oblivion, so far as worries
went.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned could not manage to forget himself. He
turned from side to side and assumed all sorts
of fresh attitudes, but his brain seemed too
entirely active, for even when he closed his eyes
he kept on thinking of everything under the sun.</p>

<p class='c008' >So midnight came and went.</p>

<p class='c008' >The small hours of the night had now arrived
and, sure enough, a coolness began to spread
about that made Ned draw that blanket up
closer to his face, much as he disliked doing
so.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once, as he was turning to avoid some small
object that felt like a root and bored into his
ribs under the double blanket, he saw something
moving over among the bushes. Looking a
second time, Ned was sure it must be a handkerchief.
Then it vanished and something else took
its place, which he made out to be the face of a
man.</p>

<p class='c008' >Evidently the party must have been trying
to catch his attention, for immediately he looked
in that direction he saw the other make a warning
gesture and then drop down again out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ned was thrilled, for he understood from this
significant sign that help must be at hand. Who
the man was he could not positively say. It may
have been Colonel Job; then again he rather
fancied that it was Chunky, the lanky puncher,
for whom all the scouts had conceived such a
liking.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lying there Ned waited to see what was going
to happen.</p>

<p class='c008' >He could hear the pawing of ponies that were
secured near by. A dog bayed the moon, as his
kind have a weakness for doing at a certain time
of each month. Other sounds there were, too,
such as might be expected in a camp like that
of the roaming cattle thieves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then Ned began to notice movements here
and there. He fancied that the camp was being
surrounded, and how his heart thrilled with
rapture at the thought. Unable to keep the
secret to himself, he kicked Harry in the shins,
and before that worthy could voice an indignant
protest, Ned was whispering the inspiring truth
in his ear.</p>

<p class='c008' >In turn Harry told Jimmy, so that presently
the three chums were lying there trying to
catch fugitive glimpses of what was going on
without exciting the suspicion of the cattle
poachers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then there was a sudden loud cry of alarm.
A woman, it turned out, had discovered the
lurking shadowy figures in the bushes, when
she awoke feeling feverish in the night, and
started for the spring close by in order to quench
her thirst.</p>

<p class='c008' >After that it was like a volcano when the
whole top blows out. There were loud shouts
and yells and screams; there came the quick
detonation of firearms and the shrieks of women
and children.</p>

<p class='c008' >The rustlers were taken quite by surprise, and
besides a bunch of the Double Cross punchers
the sheriff and his big posse was on hand, bent
on wiping out the reproach that had so long
existed in his territory, so that the camp was
pretty well surrounded on every side.</p>

<p class='c008' >In spite of all precautions, however, when the
turmoil and excitement were at their height,
some of the men managed to break away and
escape, at least for the time being.</p>

<p class='c008' >Neither Hy Adams nor the leader, Clem Parsons,
were among these lucky ones. Ned himself
had been quick to act. He had noticed so many
things since coming to the rustlers’ camp that he
could put his finger on the spot where his rifle
as also the weapons of his chums had been
stowed. And his first act was to fling himself
into that tent with all the eagerness of a hungry
hawk.</p>

<p class='c008' >He had met a man crawling out and collided
with him in such a clever way that the fellow
was knocked senseless, while the only damage
Ned sustained was a lump on the side of his
head, which later on yielded to treatment and
witch hazel.</p>

<p class='c008' >No sooner had he found his rifle than Ned was
off, in hopes of running across the leader of the
rustlers, Clem Parsons, the man who had one
of the most checkered careers back of him known
to Secret Service officials.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once again luck was with Ned, for he came
upon the tall man with the scar on his left cheek
just as he was making headlong for the neighboring
rocks. If he had once passed from the
sight of those who were busily engaged capturing
the camp, there was every reason to suspect
that the foxy rascal would not be come up with
in a hurry again.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Halt! throw up your hand, Clem Parsons.
I’ve got a warrant for your arrest. The Government
wants you at Washington, and I’ve been
asked to fetch or send you there. This rifle
shoots true, and my finger is on the trigger, so
go slow if you know what’s good for you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The rascal saw that he was in a trap and that
so long as that gun bore on him he would be
next door to crazy to attempt any hostile move.
So Ned called to Jack, whom he saw close by, to
come and tie the hands of Clem Parsons behind
his back until he could borrow a pair of steel
handcuffs from the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hy Adams was also in limbo. He had fought
like a tiger, for he was possessed of a spirit of
ferocity that could stand up before anything but
the will of his little meek-looking wife; but a
glancing blow from a clubbed gun knocked him
out, and the sheriff had him fastened up so all
his enormous strength was of no avail by the
time his wits came back to him again.</p>

<p class='c008' >Some of the rustlers managed to escape, but
the gang was broken up for good as both leaders
had fallen into the grip of the law. To finish
with Clem Parsons it might be said that the
scouts found a chance to send him on to where
he was wanted and that in due time he received
a long sentence.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hy Adams is still in a Nevada penitentiary,
and will be considerably older if he lives to
complete the sentence he received, as a stealer
of cattle and horses. Amos and his mother removed
to a town, where the boy could attend
school. Colonel Job and his wife interested
themselves in Mrs. Adams and saw that she
was placed in a position where she could earn a
good living doing sewing for the people of the
neighboring ranches. Amos expects to soon take
his place as a regular puncher on the pay roll of
the Double Cross, for boy that he is he has
proven to be as expert at rounding up and
branding cattle as any veteran might be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, having carried out his mission, Ned
could enjoy all that followed with a free heart.
And Harry, too, soon came to the conclusion
that it would be a very good and profitable
investment; so that his accounts of what the
ranch was capable of producing soon convinced
his father, who had every faith in the boy’s
judgment. Of course, Colonel Job and Mr.
Henshaw were delighted with the glowing prospect
that opened out before them.</p>

<p class='c008' >What glorious times Ned and his three scout
chums did have during the period of their stay
on the plains. They explored every nook within
three days’ journey, and even took a run over
to the famous Colorado Canyon, where Harry
was able to feast his eyes to his heart’s content
on the strange rock homes of those cliff dwellers,
the Moqui Indians; and Jack took myriads of
pictures of what they saw while in the gigantic
cleft that is reckoned one of the seven wonders
of the world.</p>

<p class='c008' >The vacation was all too short, and in the joy
of the present they could even, for the time being,
forget the terrible suffering they had endured
while making their way across country from Los
Angeles, first by automobile and then with
pack mules purchased from a prospecting party
that was starting back home disgusted with the
hard luck that had pursued them.</p>

<p class='c008' >When the time came to say good-bye to the
Double Cross Ranch and the punchers who had
come to think so highly of the scouts, Ned and
his three chums felt almost broken hearted.
They would never forget all they had gone
through with on this wonderful trip; and what
with the copious notes taken on the way, while
the stirring incidents were still fresh in their
memories, and the abundance of fine pictures
Jack carried back with him, it would seem as
though less fortunate members of the troop
might get a pretty good idea of what had happened
to their four comrades.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course, Ned and his chums were bound to
see other stirring adventures, and we only trust
that it may be our privilege to write some of
them up for the pleasure of those boys who
delight to read of brave hearts and intrepid souls
among the wearers of the khaki.</p>
